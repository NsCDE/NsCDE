- Some default file manager to be used as a Application Manager with some
  interaction between subpanels and menus. Currenty preferred is Spacefm.

- Find or write the replacement for PyQt4/PyQt5 API in Gtk/Qt theme integration
  to avoid excessive depenencies here during installation.

- FvwmScript for setting default X terminal emulator, X editor, file manager? Instead
  of manually editing <filename>$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf</filename>.

- MAJOR CHANGE: rename helper scripts uniformly, reorganize directory structure to
  better fit installation in /usr from the system package management. This can, and
  will most probably break ~/.NsCDE/libexec/colormgr.local and possibly other user's
  customizations which are calling NsCDE scripts. Write migration script, and post
  upgrade warning for new major release with this change.
