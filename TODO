- Test NsCDE with FVWM3, make it work smoothly with it, write and test

- Find or write the replacement for PyQt4/PyQt5 API in Gtk/Qt theme integration
  to avoid excessive depenencies here during installation.

- FvwmScript for setting default X terminal emulator, X editor, file manager? Instead
  of manually editing <filename>$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf</filename>.
