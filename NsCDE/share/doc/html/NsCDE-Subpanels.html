NsCDE subpanels are simple transient FvwmButton docks. As Front Panel, they
are also as much as possible similar to original CDE forms of the same
purpose. Some applications in them are predefined, and discovered if
installed, and the rest is up to user to populate.
Their purpose is not to show all possible GUI applications installed on the
system as right-click root menu. They are meant for favorite, important and often
used apps.
</p><p>
There is one main difference between CDE and NsCDE subpanels: <span class="emphasis"><em>Install Icon</em></span>
action calls special NsCDE tool for actions defining. There is no drag and
drop from the app manager (which also doesn't exist).
</p><p>
Each Subpanel's application item or entry has additional third mouse pointer button action which
will pop up dinamically populated contextual menu named after item's title. Here, there are actions
to move up or down item for one space on the subpanel, to move item to the beginning or the end of
the subpanel's application list, as well as to delete item from the subpanel (warning message will
appear before deletion is really performed). First menu item is the same as menu name: title of
the application from submenu. If clicked, it will perform default action as if item's title or icon
was clicked on the submenu itself. This is a kind of a escape from the contextual menu, but to
still use subpanel's default action without repeating opening of a submenu again.
If move or delete action is silently not performed, this is most likely the situation where
user's <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/Subpanels.actions</code> is newer than
<code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Subpanels.conf</code>, and must be rebuilt for configuration
actions to take a place properly. In that case, repeated operation must succeed, otherwise,
see X session error log for details.
</p><p>
Subpanels, like in CDE has titlebars but as windows on screen they are without
borders and handles. They have only left menu button like other windows, but
with one exception: there are no actions for closing window and re-positioning
it (no sense in this), but they have "Refresh Subpanel" and "Subpanel
Settings" controls. First one kills process module, re-reads it's
configuration and starts it on the next click on Front Panel subpanel
launcher. Subpanel Settings is the small and simple FvwmScript tool which
allows one to rename Subpanel, set it's width for application titles to fit if
necessary, and to enable or disable that particular Subpanel.
</p><p>
On the first change with <span class="emphasis"><em>Install Icon</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Subpanel Settings</em></span>,
non-FVWM configuration file <span class="emphasis"><em>Subpanels.actions</em></span> will be created in the
<code class="varname">$FVWM_USERDIR</code>, from where all subpanels changed from default will be read
by the <span class="command"><strong>$NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/generate_subpanels</strong></span>, while the rest will be
generated from the <code class="filename">$NSCDE_ROOT/config/Subpanels.actions</code>. This file can also
be edited by hand (ok, not by hand, but editor will suffice) and the result may be applied by
calling <span class="command"><strong>generate_subpanels</strong></span> and then <code class="function">f_ReadCfg Subpanels</code>.
Generated file is called <code class="filename">NsCDE-Subpanels.conf</code> and it is expected in the
<code class="varname">$FVWM_USERDIR</code>. If not found there,
<code class="filename">$NSCDE_ROOT/config/NsCDE-Subpanels.conf</code> will be read instead.
Syntax of the Subpanels.actions is explained in the
<a class="link" href="NsCDE-Configuration-Files.html" title="7. Configuration files explained">Configuration files explained</a> section.
</p><p>
Presently, there is one workaround here: as much as FVWM, and specially FvwmButtons are
very flexible and configurable, no title for the buttons app can be set apart
from module alias, but module alias doesn't support names with spaces in them.
Internal names as <span class="emphasis"><em>"NsCDE-SubpanelX"</em></span> are for that reason referenced in
<code class="filename">NsCDE-FrontPanel.conf</code>, and are internally mandatory names of their Subpanels.
Since there is no configuration option for subpanel to set Window Title, we are using here
tool <span class="command"><strong>xdotool(1)</strong></span> which is run on Subpanel initialization with a delay of 3,2
seconds (internal workaround for xdotool) and this then takes infostore
variable <code class="varname">NsCDE-SubpanelX-Name</code> and sets literal, system default or user picked
name of the subpanel. Presently, an alternative option is to apply FvwmButtons patch which introduces a
<span class="emphasis"><em>WindowName</em></span> option to it's configuration. Of course, patch will be proposed
to the upstream FVWM.
</p><p>
The rest about Subpanel, or to say their visible outfit, and their main function
are the same as in CDE - a nice, heavyweight and elegant application launchers.
