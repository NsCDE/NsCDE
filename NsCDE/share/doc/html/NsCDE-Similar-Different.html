NsCDE is not a mere clone of CDE. Under the first visual impression,
there are unintentional and intentional differences.
</p><p>
First of all, it is not a standalone Window Manager or Desktop
Environment written in some language(s). It is a patchwork which
owns 80% of it's functionality to wonderful and powerful Window Manager
of FVWM. Other parts are configurations, scripts and programs which are making the whole
thing to function like the combination of the CDE experience and modern
powerful X Window Manager. Here are some things that I can recall to
be different - for the worse or for the better, user's opinion may vary.

Differencies exist: for worse or better. They are described here in detail
with complete explanations:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
  Workspace Manager has a four fixed choices for workspaces (desks). As in CDE four is a
  default, but combinations with 2, 6 and 8 are possible. If reduced to
  2 desks, WSM buttons will grow in width to fill fixed space of the WSM
  FvwmScript applet. If 6 or 8 desks are configured, buttons will shrink
  and will be narrower. For that reason, in 6 and 8 desks mode it is not
  possible to have page indicator (<code class="filename">WSM.conf</code>: WSPPG) on the right side
  of the desk buttons,
  but this doesn't exist in CDE anyway, since CDE doesn't have concept
  of pages (in my best knowledge). This means that Front Panel has always a
  fixed width which is ok for a distinctive look and for screens with
  smaller resolutions - it will not grow or shrink depending of number
  of desks and their buttons shown in WSM.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  No drag and drop. This is specially visible in <span class="emphasis"><em>Install Icon</em></span> action
  which actually calls custom tool Subpanel Manager for this actions.
  Subpanel Manager itself will be rewritten in a nicer and less buggy
  way on the first good occasion.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  No Dt Actions builder, and never will be. Write FvwmScript scripts
    or use some toolkit in combination with python, perl ...
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  No Application Manager. If integration with <span class="emphasis"><em>Install Icon</em></span> and
    possibly menus will be possible with some file manager, it may be
    (re)invented in the future.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Keybindings are 90% custom made, and user have a choice to use it
    or - partially or totally rewrite it. There are more
    functions and actions in NsCDE than in CDE, and hence there are
    a lot of key bindings.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Mouse bindings - some actions like Workspace Menu in CDE are
    mimicked in NsCDE, titlebar and titlebar buttons too, but since
    there is no much of them in original CDE anyway, there is a plenty of
    custom mouse bindings and mouse bindings in combination with
    modifier keys. As for keybindings apply: use it or write your own.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <a class="link" href="NsCDE-ColorMgr.html" title="4.4. Color Style Manager">Color Style Manager</a> has numerous new functions: Gtk and Qt
    integration, X resources integration is optional, and it has even
    a possibility to run a custom script with required parameters of
    current palette and number of colors for external and marginal color
    scheme integrations - like <span class="command"><strong>Gkrellm</strong></span> for example.
    Palette color editor is missing. It should be possible to write it
    in the FvwmScript in some future version update.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <a class="link" href="NsCDE-FontMgr.html" title="4.6. Font Style Manager">Font Style Manager</a> is totally NsCDE oriented and doesn't work much
    as font management in CDE. NsCDE supports XFT fonts (disable
    antialiasing if you want <span class="emphasis"><em>extreme</em></span> original look) and it combines 5
    groups of fonts in 3 sizes described in this documentation.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <a class="link" href="NsCDE-KeyboardMgr.html" title="4.7. Keyboard Style Manager">Keyboard Style Manager</a> implements all options
    supported by the xset(1)
    on PC. CDE original in default installation at least, seems to have
    only auto-repeat and click volume controls.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <a class="link" href="NsCDE-PointerMgr.html" title="4.10. Mouse Style Manager">Mouse Style Manager</a> does not have
    configurable middle mouse (button
    2) action since this is not applicable very much on today's GUI widgets.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <a class="link" href="NsCDE-BeepMgr.html" title="4.3. Beep Style Manager">Beep Style Manager</a> has a additional Beep
  button for testing during setup.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Screensaver Style Manager is in fact Xscreensaver setup. Perfect
  drop in replacement and much fancier than original.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <a class="link" href="NsCDE-WindowMgr.html" title="4.16. Window Style Manager">Window Style Manager</a>
  manages much more of window, icon, pages and animation
  behavior than original program in CDE, and even this is a small subset of
  options in FVWM. See it's documentation and fvwm(1) man page.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  <a class="link" href="NsCDE-PowerSaveMgr.html" title="4.11. Power Save Manager">Power Style Manager</a> is actually very
   rare in Style Manager across
   old CDE setups. It manages DPMS setting of the monitor with xset(1).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Startup Style Manager is available only if NsCDE is started under some X Session
  Manager. It detects supported DE's and starts appropriate settings
  tool for that desktop environment if it is found.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Pages: not present in CDE in best of my knowledge. Only workspaces (desks) in
  original. Page Manager (PGM) is a custom FrontPanel icon which is using place
  left bottom of the Workspace Manager. It popups menu with the list of pages and can change current page.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Custom keyboard and mouse actions on titlebars, buttons and root window.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  WsPgMgr - Manage Workspaces and Pages. NsCDE invention.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  FpLite is measuring system load, not desktop activity. It has much
    more fine grained indication of activity with colors, and it's
    height is 3x of the original for a better visibility. On click it is
    calling FVWM function which will run terminal program with top or similar
    program, or anything else if use overrides that function in local configuration.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Calendar and Mail widgets are placeholders and simple indicators
  which are expected to be extended with already named functions
  to do what user wants.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Probably some more small differences.
