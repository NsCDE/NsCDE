Since NsCDE is basically a collection of configurations, themes and tools around FVWM
and not desktop environment in official definition, user must choose some favorite and
default applications such as X terminal emulator file manager, and X editor, which will
then be provided to him in occations where programs of that type must be called.
</p><p>
Apart from this, since <span class="emphasis"><em>system</em></span> tray concept has been introduced on X11 and is
here to stay, user will need some standalone tray application. For this
purpose, a logical and really great <span class="command"><strong>stalonetray</strong></span> (Stand Alone Tray) is more than
adequate. If NsCDE example configuration for stalonetray is used, it
will have grid 3x3 and it's place will be in the bottom right corner of
the screen. Stalonetray is not integrated into Front Panel because it's
size cannot be known in all times: is it one button size, two, ten? It is growing and
shrinking depending on number of widgets or tray icons, and apart from
that, this can significantly alter the precious CDE look of the Front Panel. A window
with traditional mwm/dtwm borders and without title in corner of the screen is
default in NsCDE. Ideas are welcome.
</p><p>
X Terminal program? <span class="command"><strong>Urxvt</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong> xterm</strong></span>,
<span class="command"><strong>mate-terminal</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong> terminus</strong></span> ... user's choice
as always. As a slight recommendation, <span class="command"><strong>mate-terminal</strong></span> from MATE DE can be
set to look almost as Dtterm, but with richer menu and better UTF-8
handling, the bad thing is that configuration if not done via GUI or configuration file but is
stored in binary DCONF registry, and registry editor like <span class="command"><strong>dconf-editor</strong></span> or
or dconf <span class="command"><strong>gsettings</strong></span> must be used for non-interactive or CLI editing.
See the example in <code class="filename">$NSCDE_ROOT/share/doc/examples/colormgr.local.example</code>
on how to integrate <span class="command"><strong>mate-terminal</strong></span> with a
<a class="link" href="NsCDE-ColorMgr.html" title="4.4. Color Style Manager">Color Style Manager</a>.
Second (if not first) best choice is <span class="command"><strong>Urxvt</strong></span>, but since it does not have a menu nor a
real tabs, tmux(1), screen(1) or possibly tabbed(1) can be used for the same functionality.
Suggestions for more dtterm-like alternative are welcome.
</p><p>
File manager? Since author does not use them very much, there is no
some strong suggestion. Maybe <span class="command"><strong>Krusader</strong></span> from KDE is a best choice because
it has a lot of features and functions plus two pane mode for work. It
looks like a total contrast to GNOME way of doing things, so it must be
good, although it is not at all similar to CDE's original dtfile(1), but
dtfile(1) is a bad and poor file manager anyway. Another reasonable
choice can be <span class="command"><strong>pcmanfm</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>pcmanfm-qt</strong></span>.
For something more <span class="emphasis"><em>original</em></span>, Xplore
file manager is written with Motif widget. It looks nice, but it is unfinished
(lacks real actions for many things, and instead input dialogs are
popped up for copy/paste ...) it is not maintained and developed, and
if someone does not brings it up from the past it can serve only for
overview of directories, simple actions and nice Motif decoration.
</p><p>
Editor? Gvim, Emacs, Xemacs, Nedit ... user's choice.
</p><p>
Another nice and useful app is <span class="command"><strong>Gkrellm</strong></span> for which
NsCDE has a ready drop-in theme called (of course) NsCDE in
<code class="filename">share/doc/examples</code> and it can be put in user's
<code class="filename">~/.gkrellm2/themes</code> and integrated with
<a class="link" href="NsCDE-ColorMgr.html" title="4.4. Color Style Manager">Color Style Manager</a>
with the <code class="filename">$NSCDE_ROOT/share/doc/examples/colormgr.local.example</code> which can be
installed as <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local</code>.
</p><p>
If standalone freedesktop autostarter <span class="command"><strong>dex-autostart</strong></span> (sometimes called "dex")
is installed, it will be used by default <code class="filename">NsCDE-Init.conf</code> function
<code class="function">CommonInitFunction</code> in local mode: it will read and start ".desktop" files
in the <code class="filename">$HOME/.config/autostart</code> directory.
</p><p>
X Compositor: if user likes visual effects with tinting, transparency,
shadows, 3D, smooth changes and so on, <span class="emphasis"><em>compton(1)</em></span> standalone compositor
is an excellent program and tool for such users - who want to combine retro and
modern style. Personally, I feel it like some kind of <span class="emphasis"><em>lag</em></span>, no matter how
powerful GPU, CPU and RAM I have. I turn it on occasionally, more as an
amusement of xsnow, xsanta or xeyes type, but when I have serious work to do,
I simply turn it off in some moment.
Maybe it can be better if it is configured more conservative than example. See
<code class="filename">/opt/NsCDE/share/doc/examples/compton-integration</code> for
a starting point.
