This tool is specific to NsCDE. It configures three things:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Number of virtual desktops
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Names of virtual desktops
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Number of virtual pages
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
This graphical tool writes files <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/WSM.conf</code>
and <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf</code>.
On the top of the window is graphical representation of the Workspace
Manager. Every button when clicked becomes editable and it's name can
be changed (pres <span class="keysym">return</span> on the text field after writing new name).
This change will be written immediately WITHOUT pressing <span class="guibutton">OK</span> button.
Name of the workspace will be changed across all NsCDE and FVWM (WSM, Occupy
Workspace/Page/Monitor, menus etc) after window manager restart is triggered with <span class="guibutton">OK</span>
button. In NsCDE, there are 4 options for desks: 2, 4, 6 and 8 desks.
FVWM itself supports infinite number, but in NsCDE care must be taken
about presentation of this desks in various applets and tools.
Nevertheless, theoretically even in NsCDE with maximum number of desks
multiplied with maximum number of pages, user can get 128 work spaces
which is probably enough (too much) for 99% of the people.
</p><p>
Check Box <span class="guibutton">Use Compact Workspace Manager</span> when checked in will
instruct NsCDE to use Workspace Manager widget in the Front Panel sized for as it is
for four workspaces, but it will expand buttons in two workspaces setup and shrink
accordingly in the case of six or eight workspaces setup. This option does not have
any visual effect on four workspaces setups.
</p><p>
Number of vertical and horizontal pages can also be configured here.
This change will affect Page Manager (PGM) icon on the Front Panel, and menus which are displaying
pages. Page names are not configurable via GUI. User is encouraged to
open <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/WSM.conf</code> and edit to suit.
</p><p>
Pop up menu prefixed as "Monitor Workspaces" allows users NsCDE with FVWM3 to select between
currently existing three modes of FVWM3 desktop configurations: global, per-monitor or shared.
When used with FVWM2, this popup will not be shown, instead, text "Global Only (FVWM2)" will
indicate non-applicability of this feature under FVWM2. Under FVWM3, new DesktopConfiguation
model is used immediately, but FVWM3 is still restarted to get consistent and clear new
behaviour of the window manager.
</p><p>
<span class="guibutton">OK</span> button saves configuration, restarts window manager and quits.
<span class="guibutton">Cancel</span> button discards, except if new names of desks are set, because
this is written immediately, but window manager is not restarted.
Workspaces and Pages Manager is called from the Front Panel's small
left button menu which is called when that button is clicked with the right
pointer button.
