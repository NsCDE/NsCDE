NsCDE from version 1.3 has late beta quality of support for FVWM3.
NsCDE is and will stay compatible for FVWM2 as long as possible.
In the time of this writing, FVWM3 was in it's fourth release and much
of the previous problems are solved, altrough it still has some problems with
FvwmPager and FvwmBacker in multi-monitor setup. Nevertheless, NsCDE will
search for "fvwm" and then "fvwm3" in <code class="varname">$PATH</code>. If both, FVWM3
and FVWM2 are installed on the same system, FVWM2 will still be used first currently.
This can be overriden in user's environment (for example <code class="filename">$HOME/.bashrc</code>)
by setting environment variable <code class="varname">FVWM_BIN</code> with the value which points to
name of the FVWM binary, or full path to the binary if for example, FVWM3 was installed from
source in some non-standard place out of the path.
</p><p>
For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
export FVWM_BIN=/opt/fvwm3/bin/fvwm3
</pre><p>
or ...
</p><pre class="programlisting">
export FVWM_BIN=fvwm3
</pre><p>
or ...
</p><pre class="programlisting">
export FVWM_BIN=fvwm
</pre><p>
</p><p>
When running with FVWM3, NsCDE will behave almost identical as in FVWM2, with
benefit of RandR support in multiple monitors setup. This allows dynamic
addition and removal of physical monitors and better management of such
configurations.
</p><p>
Probably the most notable feature of FVWM3 is <code class="varname">DesktopConfiguration</code>.
FVWM3 configuration parameter <code class="varname">DesktopConfiguration</code> decides
of workspaces layout in case of multiple monitors. For now, there are three
options: "global" (default), "per-monitor" and "shared". First option is very similar
in layout to old Xinerama support in FVWM2, while second and third model are splitting
workspaces, so different parts of different workspaces can be shown on different
monitors. NsCDE implements dynamic finding and displaying, as well as creation of
joint backdrops combinations for multiple monitors layout out of the box, so old
hack described in <code class="filename">$NSCDE_ROOT/share/doc/examples/fvwm3-per-monitor/README</code>
is not needed anymore. As in the future more desktop layouts are planned by FVWM3 developers, this
setting has it's GUI control usable on FVWM3 in the
<a class="link" href="NsCDE-WsPgMgr.html" title="4.18. Workspaces and Pages Style Manager (WsPgMgr)">Workspaces and Pages Style Manager</a>. NsCDE
provides <code class="varname">InfoStoreAdd desktopconfiguration</code> directive in
the <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf</code> when FVWM3 is used. This value can be
edited manually to contain "global", "per-monitor" or "shared" value, or Workspaces and Pages
Manager can be used for that task.
</p><p>
Third difference between NsCDE under FVWM2 and FVWM3 is logging. While FVWM2 logged
all it's actions on X server's standard output and standard error, which usually
ended up in <code class="filename">$HOME/.xsession-errors</code>, FVWM3 logs into default
or configured log file. In NsCDE this file is <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/tmp/fvwm.log</code>.
By default FVWM3 does not log anything there if not invoked with "-v" option, but
logging can be toggled by sending SIGUSR2 to FVWM3 process. When <span class="guimenuitem">Watch Errors</span>
menu item is called, it has one new option on personalized window menu which is
called from the first (left) titlebar button: <span class="guimenuitem">Togle FVWM3 Logging</span>.
When opening this log window, FVWM3 logging will be enabled almost immediately. To have logging
enabled as soon as possible when FVWM3 is started or restarted, infostore variable
<code class="varname">$[infostore.fvwm3_default_logging]</code> should be set in
<code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf</code>.
</p><p>
Caution: using NsCDE under FVWM3 is still a bit of beta quality. Local Pager shown when
changing pages and workspaces will contain primary monitor content, which will be wrong
on the secondary monitor(s). Any misbehaviour should be carefully distinguished if it is
NsCDE or FVWM3 bug while deciding where to report bugs. Watching logs, trying to trigger
the same error under FVWM2 will be a good starting point for diagnostic of such problems
which may manifest itself.
