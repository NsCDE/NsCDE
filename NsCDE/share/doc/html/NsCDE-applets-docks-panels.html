In NsCDE, CDE Front Panel is re-implemented with the help of FvwmButtons(1)
Configuration is stored under alias <span class="emphasis"><em>*FrontPanel</em></span> in
<code class="filename">NsCDE-FrontPanel.conf</code>,
read and activated from the <code class="filename">NsCDE-Main.conf</code>.
Visually, this is remake almost in a pixel as CDE Front Panel. The main
differences are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
   Since FvwmButtons doesn't implement drag and drop protocol, there is no possibility
   to install icons by dragging them from file manager or from one to another position.
   However, icons (with their applications) on the Front Panel can be customized by
   clicking any item on the subpanel above it with the right mouse button. Dinamic
   contextual menu with the name of the application will appear and action
   <span class="emphasis"><em>Copy to Main Panel</em></span> can be choosen. This will edit file
    <code class="filename">FrontPanel.actions</code> in user's <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR</code>
   and put appropriate custom launcher. All Front Panel launchers can be customized,
   including the ones with applets (watch, calendar, mail) instead of static icons.
   One notable inconvinience here is that subpanel must be enabled and icon installed
   on that subpanel before it can be copied to the main panel. If one does want to
   customize icon launcher without having subpanel above it, subpanel can be enabled
   temporary, icon installed on it, and copied to the main panel, and after this,
   subpanel can be disabled again. File <code class="filename">FrontPanel.actions</code> can
   also be edited manually as an alternative (caution should be taken) to achieve the
   same effect. Manual editing is mandatory when one wants to install new applets
   instead of static icons, because this cannot be done with gui menu actions. See
   <a class="link" href="NsCDE-Configuration-Files.html#FrontPanel_actions" title="7.1. FrontPanel.actions">FrontPanel.actions</a> for examples.
   The other way (full control) is by copying <code class="filename">FrontPanel.actions</code>
   configuration file from <code class="filename">$NSCDE_ROOT/config</code>
   to <code class="varname">$FVWM_USERDIR</code>.

   In the original CDE, Front Panel is part of the dtwm Window Manager
     binary, while in NsCDE it is configuration of FvwmButtons(1) FVWM module.
     Workspace Manager in the middle of the Front Panel is a separate applet
     written in FvwmScript(1).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   On every icon, for the first two mouse buttons different action can be
     assigned. This is used for example 7th icon where mouse button 1
     calls Style Manager, while mouse button 2 is calling Backdrop Style Manager
     directly as a quick shortcut. Second (middle) mouse button action can
     be considered as hidden hack for advanced users.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   Mouse button 3 on any of the 10 Front Panel icons brigs contextual pop-up menu
   titled by the main action from mouse button 1. Action on this menu are: a) call
   main application as if icon has been clicked with the 1st mouse button, b) "reset
   this button" which will remove user's customizations for that launcher button from
   the <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/FrontPanel.actions</code> and load default from
   the <code class="filename">$NSCDE_ROOT/config/FrontPanel.actions</code>., c) "Reset Subpanel"
   will reset upper subpanel to it's default value (remove definition of the numbered
   subpanel from the <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/Subpanels.actions</code>),
   d) "Delete Subpanel" will disable subpanel for above this icon (without resetting
   user's configuration for it), and e) Help will call this documentation.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   In addition to iconification, Front Panel can be shaded to the bottom
     edge of the screen with <span class="keysym">Shift-Esc</span> action, and put
     back in it's place with the same key binding when it is called again.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   Iconification is by default to bottom right screen edge, leaving last 96px space to the
   right for Stalonetray the while all other programs are by default iconified in the top
   left edge as in CDE.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
NsCDE Front Panel is flexible. It can be overlapped with programs, moves away (lower)
for fully maximized windows and while pretty much thick, it is not in the user's way
on the screen.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     Front Panel has it's own menu on the top left button and special context
     menu if this button is clicked with right mouse button. Middle mouse
     button behaves as if title bar of a any normal window is clicked - with
     special diagnostic tool menu. Right-clicked special menu has this
     important tasks:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>Calls Workspace and Page Manager Manager</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Restart WorkSpace Manager</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Restart Page Manager</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Number of Launchers ...

    This menu can also be called from the customized Window Options
    Menu which appears if menu button is clicked with the left mouse
    button. Item <span class="emphasis"><em>Front Panel Controls</em></span> will replace
    Window Options Menu with Front Panel Controls Menu.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
As FvwmButtons based dock, by default it swallows the following applets:

   Third icon expects <code class="varname">$[infostore.filemgr]</code> to be defined.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   Fourth icon will call <code class="varname">$[infostore.terminal]</code> which
   must be defined or it is discovered.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   Sixth or Print icon is not really usable. It should call some predefined
   printer application in the future or to be replaced with something more
   useful. Good place for personal custom icon and redefinition with
   <code class="filename">FrontPanel.actions</code>.

   Front Panel Subpanels 2, 5 and 6 are empty, but they can be activated with
   middle pointer click on an empty place, or with a contextual menu on the icon below it on the Front Panel,
   and selecting a menu item "Add Subpanel". In a former case, dialog will ask user if he wants subpanel to be
   enabled, while in later case, subpanel will be enabled immediately. This is specially useful for subpanel 5
   which will show Thunderbird if activated and if Thunderbird is installed.

   In the center of the Front Panel there is a place without subpanel
   launchers and separated by vertical line. Inside this area, there are
   4 small command icons: Left: Lock Screen (<span class="command"><strong>xscreensaver -activate</strong></span>), Page Manager Menu,
   Right are Front Panel Lite (system load indicator), and <span class="guibutton">Exit</span> button
   (SysActionDialog).
</p><p>
Lock Screen icon (upper left) has a contextual menu invoked by the 3rd mouse button click, which allows
user to suspend and resume background activity of the xscreensaver(1) in addition to the locking
mechanism. Help menu entry is also present. Mouse button 2 brings Xscreensaver preferences dialog as if
it was called from the Style Manager.
</p><p>
Page Manager Menu icon has a contextual menu invoked by the 3rd mouse button click. In addition to
returning back to main menu, it can call visual local FVWM pager LocalPager. Help menu entry is
present too. Mouse button 2 brings Workspaces and Pages Style Manager configuration.
</p><p>
Front Panel Lite (upper right) has a small contextual menu which calls main action and help.
</p><p>
Exit button (lower right) has a small contextual menu which calls main action and help.
</p><p>
   In the middle of this area there is WSM - Work Space Manager with well
   known four buttons for four virtual desks. By default, four desks are
   shown and configured, but this can be changed
   (see <a class="xref" href="NsCDE-Workspace-Manager.html" title="3.3. Workspace Manager">Section 3.3, &#8220;Workspace Manager&#8221;</a>).
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="NsCDE-FrontPanelNrOofLaunchers"></a>3.1.1. Customizing number of Front Panel launchers</h4></div></div></div><p>
NsCDE Front Panel can be customized to contain from zero to 20 Front Panel buttons or launchers.
Default is 10 (5 launchers left and 5 launchers right from the Workspace Manager). There can be
even or unequal number of launchers on any side of the Front Panel. In that way, it is possible
to:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Extend number of launchers (buttons)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Move Workspace Manager to left or right
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Reduce number of launchers
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Extend or reduce number of subpanels on active launchers
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
All extended (more than 5 on each side) launchers can be customized with icons,
subpanels and swallowed applets.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This is very flexible scheme, and can scale from minimal two-workspaces configuration
without any launcher (just left and right handlers, and Workspace Manager with Lock, FpLite,
Exit and Page Manager in the middle), up to configuration with 20 launchers freely arranged
left and right with up to eight workspaces. For this last one, Full HD resolution, or at
least 1680x1050 is needed.
</p><p>
To change number of launchers left or right of the Workspace Manager, leftmost menu button
of the Front Panel must be selected, which will bring Window Options Menu, then
<span class="emphasis"><em>Front Panel Controls</em></span> can be selected to replace Window Options Menu.
Front Panel Controls can be directly called by clicking this same button with third
(right) mouse button. Next, <span class="emphasis"><em>Number of Launchers ...</em></span> submenu must be
opened.
</p><p>
Actions are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Add Left Launcher
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Add Right Launcher
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Remove Left Launcher
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Remove Right Launcher
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Help
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once a new launcher is on the Front Panel, it can be customized by the means of enabling
(temporary or permanently) subpanel on which icons can be installed, or by editing
configuration <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/FrontPanel.actions</code> and restarting the
Front Panel. Under the hood, adding or removing launchers on the Front Panel is
actually editing FVWM InfoStore variables <code class="varname">FP.LeftLaunchersNum</code> and
<code class="varname">FP.RightLaunchersNum</code> in the <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf</code>
which are both by default 5. Front Panel geometry is automatically recalculated on
restart.
