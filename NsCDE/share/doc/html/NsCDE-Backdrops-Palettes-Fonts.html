Together  with Workspace Manager, Backdrops and Palettes are probably most
known things in CDE by which it is visually recognized.
</p><p>
Backdrops, as many probably know are relatively simple XPM textures and
pictures consisting usualy from 2-5 <span class="emphasis"><em>base</em></span> colors: <span class="emphasis"><em>background</em></span>,
<span class="emphasis"><em>foreground</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>selectColor</em></span>,
<span class="emphasis"><em>topShadowColor</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>bottomShadowColor</em></span>.
This colors are taken from the current (or custom) palette and applied to the symbolic
definition of colors in XPM templates. Backdrop is then generated, tiled and
applied to the root window. Every desk can have it's own backdrop texture. In
4 colors mode of the palette theme, they are all colored in the same pattern,
while in 8 colors mode, every desk from 1-4 has it's own color variant from
the current palette. If there are more that four desks defined, fifth is
repeated color of the first, sixth of the second and so on.
</p><p>
Here, in addition to original CDE textures, there are some 100 new and custom
textures created from (free and public) textures which were convenient for
this customization. In other words, NsCDE implements more than 100 backdrops,
and with Backdrop Style Manager user can import to it's
<code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/backdrops</code> it's own backdrops,
or put them there with terminal or file manager.
</p><p>
Backdrops must have alternative extension for X Pixmaps: that is, not <span class="emphasis"><em>.xpm</em></span>,
but <span class="emphasis"><em>.pm</em></span>.
</p><p>
If one wants their custom backdrop to be dynamic with palette/theme of NsCDE,
one must edit them to set symbolic names of the colors described above. See
existing backdrops to get an idea. Apart from symbolic names, backdrops also
have a real color defined to be compatible with XPM specification, but values of
this colors can be arbitrary, since they are not used if symbolic name on the
same line is set.
</p><p>
Default backdrops are set from the
<code class="filename">$NSCDE_ROOT/share/defaults/backer</code> until
user does not redefine/set his own with
<a class="link" href="NsCDE-BackdropMgr.html" title="4.2. Backdrop Style Manager">Backdrop Style Manager</a>. Default
palette is <span class="emphasis"><em>Broica</em></span> in 8 colors variant.
</p><p>
Backdrops generated by <a class="link" href="NsCDE-BackdropMgr.html" title="4.2. Backdrop Style Manager">Backdrop Style manager</a> are put in user's
<code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/backer/DeskN-&lt;backdropname&gt;.pm</code> and defined in
<code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Backdrops.conf</code> as colorsets of
<span class="emphasis"><em>TiledPixmap</em></span> type. NsCDE reserved FVWM colorsets numbers for backdrops
are from 31-38 for all eight possible desktops.
This file is read by FvwmBacker(1) FVWM module. It is automatically generated when user makes
first change with <a class="link" href="NsCDE-BackdropMgr.html" title="4.2. Backdrop Style Manager">Backdrop Style Manager</a>.
</p><p>
Until then, file <code class="filename">$NSCDE_ROOT/config/NsCDE-Backdrops.conf</code> is read, which
itself reads pre-generated and pre-defined backdrops from the
<code class="filename">$NSCDE_ROOT/share/defaults/backer</code> directory.
</p><p>
We can conclude that backdrops are source form or template file, and when processed
with color values from the palette, this backdrop's final form is, ready to be set by FvwmBacker(1).
