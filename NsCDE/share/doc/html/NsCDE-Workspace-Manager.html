Workspace Manager is a Widget in the center of the Front Panel. Visually, it
replicates in almost a pixel similarity with the center of the CDE's Workspace
Manager's buttons, but with a few exceptions beneath the surface and further
configuration:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
 There is a limited number for possible of workspaces. There can be no odd number of
  workspaces, and combinations are: 2, 4, 6 and 8. Default is of course 4.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 If InfoStore variable wsm.eco is defined as <span class="emphasis"><em>"InfoStoreAdd wsm.eco 1"</em></span> in
 user's profile <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf</code>, WSM buttons will not be fixed
 in width as in CDE. They are not extending a width of the Front Panel, rather they are more
 wide in 2-buttons combination, and narrow in 6 and specially 8 button combination. By default,
 buttons are all of the same width and they are extending or narrowing width of the Front Panel
 if changed from default 4 workspaces to 2, 6 or 8.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 As in CDE, workspace names can be renamed. There is a keyboard combination in
  FvwmScript WSM which enters rename mode: Ctrl+Space on the current active
  desk, while pointer is inside WSM. <span class="keysym">Ctrl+Enter</span> saves new name. Names are
  synchronized with FVWM desktop names and used in the rest of the
  configuration. Names are saved in <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/WSM.conf</code>, and EWMH
  desktop names are applied immediately in a existing X11 NsCDE session.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
If Sun type keyboard is in use, <span class="keysym">Help</span> key above
WSM will bring this help text in browser. On PC keyboard, <span class="keysym">F1</span> has the
same function.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Addition: right mouse button on workspace button brings contextual menu. From
  this menu, the following items can be selected: default acion (activate workspace),
  <span class="guimenuitem">Rename</span> to rename the workspace, <span class="guimenuitem">Manage</span>
  to call Workspace and Page Manager, <span class="guimenuitem">Local Pager</span> (visual FvwmPager)
  (for a workspace, not necessarily the current one), then the option
  <span class="guimenuitem">Windows ...</span> to bring up Window List,
  with windows on that workspace, and last, a small submenu
  <span class="guimenuitem">Go to Page ...</span> for changing the active page on the that
  workspace, which will of course change active workspace to that where page was selected.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 If <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/WSM.conf</code> value <span class="emphasis"><em>WSPPG</em></span> is 1,
  then in 2 or 4 desks/buttons
  mode a small current page indicator is show on the right side of the button.
  In addition to Page Manager Icon southwest of the WSM. Disabled (0) by default.
  <code class="filename">WSM.conf</code> (system wide: <code class="filename">$NSCDE_ROOT/config/WSM.conf</code>) is
  a separate configuration
  file read by WSM, WsPgMgr and such. Not a FVWM configuration file.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Number of Workspaces and Pages can be configured with Workspace and Page Manager
  tool which is called with right pointer click on Front Panel's left button
  and selected from the menu.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
State of the buttons is synchronized by FVWM function called from FvwmEvent(1)
module whenever desks and pages are changed by other means, such as keyboard
shortcut, mouse move, or <span class="command"><strong>FvwmCommand(1)</strong></span>.
</p><p>
In 4 color palette mode, all WSM buttons are of the same color, while in 8 colors
mode, there are four color variations from the given palette. In the 8 colors mode,
InfoStore option wsmcolored in the <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf</code> can be
set to 1 to get background of the WSM colored as button 3, which was the case on some
versions of the CDE. By default, this value is 0.
</p><p>
Workspaces in NsCDE are named and numbered from 1, while in FVWM (where they are called desks),
they start from 0. This fact required additional effort while coding FvwmScripts and making
default and core configuration.
