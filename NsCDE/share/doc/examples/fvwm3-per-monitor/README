Preliminary FVWM3 DesktopConfiguration per-monitor support for NsCDE

Warning: this is "technology preview" which is overriding system FvwmBacker
configuration in NsCDE-Backer.conf with the version which uses a kludge
shell script "nitrowrapper" which should be located in the user's
$FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/ and external background settet "nitrogen" to
translate RandR monitor names into format expected by the nitrogen(1)
program.

Until FVWM3 FvwmBacker is not monitor aware, this method can be used to
set different backdrop on different monitors under FVWM3.

Instructions:

- Install nitrogen (yum apt pacman pkg whatever ...)

- Copy NsCDE-Backer.conf into your ~/.NsCDE/

- Copy nitrowrapper into your ~/.NsCDE/libexec/

- Edit ~/.NsCDE/libexec/nitrowrapper and assign monitor names to
  variables MONITOR0, MONITOR1, MONITOR2, MONITORN ...

- Make it executable: chmod 0755 ~/.NsCDE/libexec/nitrowrapper

- Uncomment or add if not present

  Test (EnvMatch FVWM_IS_FVWM3 1) DesktopConfiguration per-monitor

  line in your ~/.NsCDE/NsCDE.conf

- At the beginning of InitFuncation in your ~/.NsCDE/NsCDE-Init.conf put

  + I Exec exec nitrogen --set-tiled $[HOME]/.NsCDE/backer/Desk1-*

  to set initial background on both monitors after login (it will be on
  first workspace)

- Restart FVWM3 / NsCDE see if it is working for you. Experiment with
  FVWM3 and enjoy


Caveats:

- Setter nitrogen does not have rich error checking in it. Therefore,
  it can core dump occasionally. For example when adding or removing
  monitors if it is called early from ~/.NsCDE/NsCDE-Backer.conf and
  it's wrapper, but since this is not long running process (daemon)
  it is mostly not noticable

- This whole hack is temporary solution for early versions of FVWM3
  Once FVWM3 Backer gets ready, this will be obsoleted and soon removed.

Misc:

- There is one Linux only hack scripting solution for auto-plugging
  and configuring multiple monitors in multiple environments. It may
  be useful for people with notebooks who are traveling and changing
  multiple monitors is 2-3 or more places.
