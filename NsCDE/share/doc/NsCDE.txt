Introduction

  What is NsCDE?

    In a nutshell, NsCDE is the CDE clone. Tehnically, it can be considered a
   heavy FVWM theme enriched with additional free software tools and
   applications, combining all this components into something which can be
   called lightweight hybrid desktop environment. It can even be integrated
   into existing desktop environments as a window manager wrapper for session
   handling and additional DE functionality.

    NsCDE's main goal is to revive look and feel of the Common Desktop
   Environment found on many UNIX and unix-like systems during nineties and
   first decade of the 21 century, but with a slightly polished interface
   (XFT, unicode, dynamic changes, rich key and mouse bindings, desk pages,
   rich menus etc) and a goal to produce comfortable "retro" environment
   which is not just a eye candy toy, but a real working environment for
   users who contrary to mainstream trends really like CDE, thus making
   semi-optimal blend of usability and compatibility with modern tools with
   look and feel which mainstream abadoned for some new fashion, and ... in a
   nutshell, giving to user the best of the both worlds.

    Main driver behind NsCDE is the excellent FVWM window manager with it's
   endless options for customization, GUI Script engine, Colorsets, and
   modules. NsCDE is largely a wrapper around FVWM - something like a
   heavyweight theme, sort of.

    Other main components are GTK2, GTK3, Qt4 and Qt5 theme for unifying look
   and feel for the most Unix/Linux applications, custom scripts which are
   helpers and backend workers for GUI parts and some data from the original
   CDE, as icons, palettes, and backdrops.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Why NsCDE?

    Since the 90-ties, I have always liked this environment and it's somewhat
   crude socrealistic look in a contrast to "modern" Windows and GNOME
   approach which is going in the opposite taste from what I always liked to
   see on my screen. I have created this environment for my own usage 8-10
   years ago and it was a patchwork, chaotic and not well suited for sharing
   with someone. While it looked ok on the surface, behind it was a years of
   ad hoc hacks and senseless configurations and scripts, dysfunctional menus
   etc. Couple of months in a row I had a time and chance to rewrite this as
   a more consistent environment, first for myself, and during this process,
   idea came to do it even better, and put on the web for everyone else who
   may like this idea of modern CDE.

    NsCDE is intended for a people which doesn't like "modern" hypes,
   interfaces that try to mimic Mac and Windows and reimplementing their
   ideas for non-technical user's desktops, and reimplementing them poorly.
   Older and mature system administrators, programmers and generally people
   from the Unix background are more likely to have attraction to NsCDE. It
   is probably not well suited for beginners.

    Of course, question arises: why not simply use original original CDE now
   when it is open sourced?

    Apart from desirable look, because it has it's own problems: it is a
   product from 90-ties, based on Motif and time has passed since then. In
   CDE there is no really XFT font rendering, no immediate application
   dynamic changes. Beside that, I have found dtwm, CDE's window manager
   inferior to FVWM and some 3rd party solutions which can be paired with it.
   So I wanted the best of the two worlds: good old retro look and feel from
   original CDE, but more flexible, modern and maintained "driver" behind it,
   which will allow for individual customizations as one find's them fit for
   it's own amusement and usage. As it will be seen later, there are some
   intentional differences between CDE and NsCDE - a middle line between
   trying to stay as close as possible to look of the CDE, but with more
   flexibility and functionality on the second and third look.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Components of the NsCDE

  Components overview

    NsCDE is a wrapper and a bunch of configurations, scripts and apps around
   FVWM. FVWM is in my opinion a model of free choice for people who like to
   have things set up by their own wishes and who are aware what real freedom
   of choice is. A stunning contrast to policies forced on Linux users in the
   last decade from the mainstream desktop players.

    NsCDE is by default rooted in /opt/NsCDE ($NSCDE_ROOT), but it can be
   relocated with only one variable changed in main wrapper bin/nscde and
   NsCDE-Main.conf.

    It is not using your existing $HOME/.fvwm but sets $FVWM_USERDIR to
   $HOME/.NsCDE, and uses /opt/NsCDE/config as a sources of configuration.

    Configuration model is a bit complex, but very flexible: configuration
   options are grouped in logical order. Configuration files are names
   NsCDE-<group>.conf. For example, NsCDE-Functions.conf for FVWM functions.
   Each configuration file can have two exclusive sources, and one
   additional. For example, if user doesn't have
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Functions.conf, then
   $NSCDE_ROOT/config/NsCDE-Functions.conf is read as default. Additionally,
   if $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Functions.local exists, it will be read in addition
   to conf file, from wherever it was read. This is intended as a primary
   mechanism for customization: If user doesn't need to override and change a
   lot of "system" configuration, but just add it's own in addition to
   existing, local file is place for such customization (of course, most
   parts of the existing FVWM configuration can be overridden or destroyed
   and recreated even in local files.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Applets and GUI Tools

    NsCDE provides GUI tools which are built in FvwmScript(1) and their shell
   and python helpers. Also, some external applications that fit in the
   picture as recommended. This tools are mainly built by me, but some, such
   as mouse, keyboard and beep control are modified from the default FVWM
   scripts to look more CDEish and they implement some additional
   functionality.

    Applets docks and panels are:

     * Front Panel (FvwmButtons)

     * Subpanels (FvwmButtons)

     * Workspace Manager (WSM) - FvwmScript

     * Page Manager (PGM) - FvwmScript

     * MonthDayApplet - FvwmScript

     * Clock - External C applet pclock

     * CheckMailApplet - FvwmScript

     * FpLite - FvwmScript

    GUI tools are:

     * Style Manager (StlyeMgr) - FvwmScript

     * Backdrop Style Manager (BackdropMgr) - FvwmScript + Korn Shell

     * Beep Style Manager - FvwmScript

     * Color Style Manager (ColorMgr) - FvwmScript

     * ExecDialog - FvwmScript

     * Font Style Manager (FontMgr) - FvwmScript + Korn Shell

     * Keyboard Style Manager (KeyboardMgr) - FvwmScript

     * Occupy Workspace (OccupyWorkspace) - FvwmScript

     * Mouse Style Manager (PointerMgr) - FvwmScript

     * Power Save Manager (PowerSaveMgr) - FvwmScript

     * Subpanel Manager (SubpanelMgr) - FvwmScript

     * Subpanel Settings (SubpanelSettings) - FvwmScript

     * System Action Dialog (SysActionDialog) - FvwmScript, sudo

     * Sysinfo - FvwmScript, python

     * Window Style Manager (WindowMgr) - FvwmScript, sed, egrep

     * Workspaces and Pages Manager (WsPgMgr) - FvwmScript

    Helper Dialogs:

     * ActionForm - FvwmScript

     * ChoiceForm - FvwmScript

     * FilePicker - FvwmScript

     * InputForm - FvwmScript

     * WaitNotice - FvwmScript

     * NColorsDialog ([20]Color Style Manager part) - FvwmScript

     * PaletteDialog - (Backdrop Style Manager part) - FvwmScript

    External fit-in Programs:

     * Xscreensaver (xscreensaver-demo called from StyleMgr) installed
       separately.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Applets Docks and Panels

  Front Panel

    In NsCDE, CDE Front Panel is mimicked and re-implemented with the help of
   FvwmButtons(1) Configuration is done under alias *FrontPanel in
   NsCDE-FrontPanel.conf, read and activated from the NsCDE-Main.conf.
   Visually, this is remake almost in a pixel as CDE Front Panel. The main
   differences are:

     *   Icons are static in configuration. FvwmButtons doesn't implement
       drag and drop protocol. It can be changed and customized in a two
       ways: first one, 8 of 10 icons (minus swallowed applets clock,
       calendar and mail that is) can be dinamically changed by writing
       button actions and icon paths in FrontPanel.actions in user's
       $FVWM_USERDIR and this will be applied after reading static
       configuration and running Front Panel for a piece of a second. The
       other way (full control) is by copying configuration file from
       $NSCDE_ROOT/config to $FVWM_USERDIR.

     *   In the original CDE, Front Panel is part of the dtwm Window Manager
       binary, while here it is configuration of FvwmButtons(1) FVWM module.
       Workspace Manager in the middle of the Front Panel is a separate
       applet written in FvwmScript(1).

     *   On every icon, for all 3 main mouse buttons different action can be
       assigned. This is used for example 8th icon where mouse button 1 calls
       editor, while mouse button 3 is calling file manager (if defined)

     *   In addition to iconification, Front Panel can be shaded to the
       bottom edge of the screen with Shift-Esc action, and put in a place
       with the same shortcut again.

     *   Iconification is by default to bottom right screen edge, while all
       other programs are by default iconified in the top left edge as in
       CDE.

     *   It is flexible, can be overlapped with programs, moves away for
       fully maximized windows and while pretty much thick, not in the way
       while not needed.

     *   - It has it's own menu on top left button and special context menu
       if this button is clicked with right mouse button. Middle mouse button
       behaves as if title bar is clicked - with special diagnostic tool
       menu. Right-clicked special menu has this important tasks:

          * Calls Workspace and Page Manager Manager

          * Restart WorkSpace Manager

          * Restart Page Manager

          * Restart Panel Clock (pclock)

          * Restart Panel Mail Applet

          * Restart Panel Date (MonthDayApplet)

          * Restart Panel Lite (FpLite)

          * Restart the whole Front Panel

     *  As FvwmButtons based dock, it swallows the following applets:

          * pclock (external standalone app with CDEish skin)

          * MonthDayApplet (FvwmScript)

          * CheckMailApplet (FvwmScript)

          * PGM (FvwmScript)

          * WSM / Workspace Manager (FvwmScript)

          * FpLite (FvwmScript)

     *   Third icon expects $[infostore.filemgr] to be defined.

     *   Fourth icon will call $[infostore.terminal] which must be defined or
       it is discovered.

     *   Sixth or Print icon is not really usable. It should call some
       predefined printer application in the future or to be replaced with
       something more useful. Good place for personal custom icon and
       redefinition with FrontPanel.actions.

     *   Seventh: [21]Style Manager - clone of the well known CDE Launcher of
       "Style" tools.

     *   $[infostore.xeditor] - if defined in $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf.

     *   Semi-empty. By default, it popups 9th subpanel if pressed. A nice
       idea is to call pavucontrol or some audio mixer on 3rd mouse click
       from FrontPanel.actions.

     *   Help, documentation.

     *   Front Panel Subpanels 2, 5 and 6 are empty, but they can be
       activated with middle pointer click on an empty place. Dialog will ask
       user if he wants it enabled. This is specially useful for subpanel 5
       which will show Thunderbird if activated and if Thunderbird is
       installed.

          *   Subpanel 1: Applications

          *   Subpanel 3: Libre Office Components and various
            office/productivity tools

          *   Subpanel 4: System Tools

          *   Subpanel 7: NsCDE Style Manager and various Qt, Gtk and misc
            management applications

          *   Subpanel 8: Tools

          *   Subpanel 9: Multimedia programs: audio, video, photo ...

          *   Subpanel 10: Documentation

     *   In the center of the Front Panel there is a place without subpanel
       launchers and separated by vertical line. Inside this area, there are
       4 small command icons: Left: Lock Screen (xscreensaver -activate),
       Page Manager (PGM), Right are Front Panel Lite (system load
       indicator), and Exit button (SysActionDialog).

         In the middle of this area there is WSM - Work Space Manager with
       well known four buttons for four virtual desks. By default, four desks
       are shown and configured, but this can be changed (see [22]the Section
       called Workspace Manager).

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Subpanels

    NsCDE subpanels are simple transient FvwmButton docks. As Front Panel,
   they are also as much as possible similar to original CDE forms of the
   same purpose. Some applications in them are predefined, and discovered if
   installed, and the rest is up to user to populate. Their purpose is not to
   show all possible GUI applications installed on the system as right-click
   root menu. They are meant for favorite, important and often used apps.

    There is one main difference between CDE and NsCDE subpanels: Install
   Icon action calls special NsCDE tool for actions defining. There is no
   drag and drop from the app manager (which also doesn't exist).

    Each Subpanel's application item or entry has additional third mouse
   pointer button action which will pop up dinamically populated contextual
   menu named after item's title. Here, there are actions to move up or down
   item for one space on the subpanel, to move item to the beginning or the
   end of the subpanel's application list, as well as to delete item from the
   subpanel (warning message will appear before deletion is really
   performed). First menu item is the same as menu name: title of the
   application from submenu. If clicked, it will perform default action as if
   item's title or icon was clicked on the submenu itself. This is a kind of
   a escape from the contextual menu, but to still use subpanel's default
   action without repeating opening of a submenu again. If move or delete
   action is silently not performed, this is most likely the situation where
   user's $FVWM_USERDIR/Subpanels.actions is newer than
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Subpanels.conf, and must be rebuilt for configuration
   actions to take a place properly. In that case, repeated operation must
   succeed, otherwise, see X session error log for details.

    Subpanels, like in CDE has titlebars but as windows on screen they are
   without borders and handles. They have only left menu button like other
   windows, but with one exception: there are no actions for closing window
   and re-positioning it (no sense in this), but they have "Refresh Subpanel"
   and "Subpanel Settings" controls. First one kills process module, re-reads
   it's configuration and starts it on the next click on Front Panel subpanel
   launcher. Subpanel Settings is the small and simple FvwmScript tool which
   allows one to rename Subpanel, set it's width for application titles to
   fit if necessary, and to enable or disable that particular Subpanel.

    On the first change with Install Icon or Subpanel Settings, non-FVWM
   configuration file Subpanels.actions will be created in the $FVWM_USERDIR,
   from where all subpanels changed from default will be read by the
   $NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/generate_subpanels, while the rest will be generated
   from the $NSCDE_ROOT/config/Subpanels.actions. This file can also be
   edited by hand (ok, not by hand, but editor will suffice) and the result
   may be applied by calling generate_subpanels and then f_ReadCfg Subpanels.
   Generated file is called NsCDE-Subpanels.conf and it is expected in the
   $FVWM_USERDIR. If not found there, $NSCDE_ROOT/config/NsCDE-Subpanels.conf
   will be read instead. Syntax of the Subpanels.actions is explained in the
   [23]Configuration files explained section.

    Presently, there is one workaround here: as much as FVWM, and specially
   FvwmButtons are very flexible and configurable, no title for the buttons
   app can be set apart from module alias, but module alias doesn't support
   names with spaces in them. Internal names as "NsCDE-SubpanelX" are for
   that reason referenced in NsCDE-FrontPanel.conf, and are internally
   mandatory names of their Subpanels. Since there is no configuration option
   for subpanel to set Window Title, we are using here tool xdotool(1) which
   is run on Subpanel initialization with a delay of 3,2 seconds (internal
   workaround for xdotool) and this then takes infostore variable
   NsCDE-SubpanelX-Name and sets literal, system default or user picked name
   of the subpanel. Presently, an alternative option is to apply FvwmButtons
   patch which introduces a WindowName option to it's configuration. Of
   course, patch will be proposed to the upstream FVWM.

    The rest about Subpanel, or to say their visible outfit, and their main
   function are the same as in CDE - a nice, heavyweight and elegant
   application launchers.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Workspace Manager

    Workspace Manager is a Widget in the center of the Front Panel. Visually,
   it replicates in almost a pixel similarity with the center of the CDE's
   Workspace Manager's buttons, but with a few exceptions beneath the surface
   and further configuration:

     *   There is a limited number for possible of desks. There can be no odd
       number of desks, and combinations are: 2, 4, 6 and 8. Default is of
       course 4.

     *   Buttons are not fixed in width size as in CDE. They are not
       extending a width of the Front Panel, rather they are more wide in
       2-buttons combination, and narrow in 6 and 8 button combination.

     *   As in CDE, desk names can be renamed. There is a keyboard
       combination in FvwmScript WSM which enters rename mode: Ctrl+Space on
       the current active desk, while pointer is inside WSM. Ctrl+Enter saves
       new name. Names are synchronized with FVWM desktop names and used in
       the rest of the configuration. Names are saved in
       $FVWM_USERDIR/WSM.conf

     *   Addition: right mouse button on desk button brings contextual menu.
       From this menu, global (all desks and their pages), or local (pages of
       the one desk) FvwmPager - visual pager can be called. Below this menu
       options, there is an option to bring up Window List, and small submenu
       for changing the active page on the current desk.

     *   If $FVWM_USERDIR/WSM.conf value WSPPG is 1, then in 2 or 4
       desks/buttons mode a small current page indicator is show on the right
       side of the button. In addition to Page Manager (PGM) southwest of the
       WSM. Disabled (0) by default. WSM.conf (system wide:
       $NSCDE_ROOT/config/WSM.conf) is a separate configuration file read by
       WSM, PGM, WsPgMgr and such. Not a FVWM configuration file.

     *   Number of Desks and Pages can be configured with Workspace and Page
       Manager tool which is called with right pointer click on Front Panel's
       left button and selected from the menu.

    State of the buttons is synchronized by FVWM function called from
   FvwmEvent(1) module whenever desks and pages are changed by other means,
   such as keyboard shortcut, mouse move, or FvwmCommand(1).

    In 4 color palette mode, all WSM buttons are of the same color, while in
   8 colors mode, there are four color variations from the given palette.

    Desks in NsCDE are named and numbered from 1, while in FVWM, they start
   from 0. This fact required additional effort while coding FvwmScripts and
   making default and core configuration.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Page Manager

    Page Manager is entirely new thing. There is no concept of Pages in the
   original CDE, just desks (workspaces). This nice feature of pages is too
   useful to be disabled and sacrificed just to get even more CDE similarity,
   but really zealous user can configure NsCDE not to include pages, just
   desks. PGM is a small FvwmScript applet southwest from the WSM,
   represented by the silver-gray icon of the desk divided on pagesX x
   pagesY. Default is 2x2, that is, four pages per every desk, which in
   default first run gives 4 x 4 = 16 screens for applications. Minimum for
   pages is 0, and maximum 16. For example, in maximal desks+pages
   configuration, one gets 8x16 desktop, that is 128 screens! While
   undoubtedly this is diversion from a more flexible plain FVWM
   configuration, it covers really great number of possible preferences.
   Pages can be configured in any XxY combination. For example 1x4, 2x3, 3x3,
   2x1, 2x2 ...

    PGM changes icon to represent position of the current page on current
   desk while user moves from page to page automatically with the help of the
   FvwmEvent(1) just like the WSM.

    When clicked, PGM transforms in a closed popup menu with names of the
   pages and special "..." option on the top which calls local visual
   FvwmPager. When option from the menu is selected, menu again transforms to
   the Icon. If called, but not clicked, menu automatically transforms back
   into Icon after 20 seconds of inactivity. Middle pointer button calls
   Workspace and Page Manager, while the right pointer button calls visual
   Local Pager.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  MonthDayApplet

    Usual CDE icon with month and day of the month in it. Simple applet which
   calls empty, do-nothing (by default) function f_Calendar. This function
   can be overridden in $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Functions.local to call a program
   which user wishes.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Front Panel Clock - pclock

    This is a small C program (GPL) written many years ago by Alexander
   Kourakos. It supports XPM skins and displays hours, minutes and seconds.
   It is well suited for window manager docks like FvwmButtons(1). In NsCDE
   it is applied with a skin similar to original one, but slightly bigger and
   with more clear edges and colors. Default can be used from
   $NSCDE_ROOT/share/icons/CDE or even replaced with a Solaris version with
   picture of the globe with red hands for hours and minutes and white for
   seconds. If clicked, it will try to execute firefox by default (which
   appears doesn't work if FVWM is started under some desktop environment
   like MATE). Pclock C source is provided for user's convenience if it needs
   to be recompiled on another system or architecture. Source is in
   $NSCDE_ROOT/src/pclock-0.13.1. With NsCDE binary for Linux is provided by
   default in $NSCDE_ROOT/bin.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Check Mail Applet

    Fifth icon from the left on Front Panel is FvwmScript applet. It is
   calling f_CheckMail FVWM function every minute. If clicked, function is
   called immediately. By default f_CheckMail is an empty function. Up to
   user is to redefine it in his $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Functions.local to suit
   the needs for mail checking. To be clear, by default, it is not functional
   as an applet. Above this applet, there is an empty space for subpanel
   launcher which can be activated with middle click, and it will present
   Thunderbird entry if thunderbird is installed. User can use Install Icon
   action to change or add entries on this menu. For example, to call urxvt
   -e mutt or something like that.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FpLite

    Load Indicator on the top right side of the center of the Front Panel
   contains a small applet called FpLite. In original CDE it was used to
   indicate desktop activity, but since on today's processors this tasks are
   short and almost immediate (specially with a good window manager such as
   FVWM), I find it better suited to show system load. It has 10 micro-bars.
   When there is no load, all are yellow. Load grows from left to right.
   First 5 green bars, then 3 blue, 2 magenta, an after that it starts from
   the beginning with red bars. FpLite summarizes load of all CPUs on the
   system in a way that 1-minute load is divided with number of CPU cores,
   and then counted as such while displaying load with color micro-bars.
   Everything under 1 (internally 100) is yellow, green, blue and magenta,
   and after that it counts 10 red micro-bars. For example: on the system
   with 2 CPU cores, 1-minute load of 0.6 will be presented with 3 bars (0.6
   / num-cores), load of 2.2 will be presented with one red bar etc ... on
   the system with four CPU cores load of 3 will be magenta on the two
   rightmost bars, and load of 4 or more will be red. Load of more than
   (numcpu * 10) will not be shown specially, but user gets an idea what is
   going on if FpLite is all red. If clicked, it will call a function
   f_FpLiteClickAction which is by default set to safe defaults ([default
   terminal app] -e top). FpLite FvwmScript app uses little portable python
   script getla1.py from the $NSCDE_ROOT/libexec to obtain 1-minute load
   data.

GUI Tools

  Style Manager

    This Window is a starting point for all other Style Manager applications
   to be called. It is called from 7th button on the Front Panel. It has big
   icons for calling:

     * [24]Color Style Manager

     * [25]Font Style Manager

     * [26]Backdrop Style Manager

     * [27]Keyboard Style Manager

     * [28]Mouse Style Manager

     * [29]Beep Style Manager

     * Xscreensaver Demo (setup)

     * [30]Window Style Manager

     * [31]Power Style Manager

     * Startup Style Manager

    If NsCDE was started under X Session Manager, Startup Style Manager icon
   will call setup tool for that session manager or DE. Otherwise, error
   message is displayed: either that NsCDE was not started under X Session
   Management, or X Session Manager is not recognized, and it's setup tool
   cannot be run. Currently, only MATE, LXDE, KDE and GNOME session managers
   are recognized and their respective tools called. See [32]the Section
   called NsCDE Startup about running NsCDE under X Session Manager for more
   information about this matter.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Ctrl+Q: Quits Style Manager.

  Backdrop Style Manager

    Part of the Style Managers which can be called from the main Style
   Manager (7th button on the Front Panel). This is the clone of the
   same-named CDE tool. It loads backdrops from the
   $NSCDE_ROOT/share/backdrops and $FVWM_USERDIR/backdrops (if any). From XPM
   backdrop templates with symbol names (with .pm extension) it will generate
   previews in user's $FVWM_USERDIR/tmp and if applied or OK'ed, will set
   permanent backdrop in $FVWM_USERDIR/backer. Backer is named after
   FvwmBacker(1) module which then loads this X Pixmap as numbered FVWM
   Colorset from the $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Backdrops.conf which will be written
   by Backdrop Style Manager (or by hand). Backdrops are generated in the
   colors of the current color theme from the active palette (Broica by
   default). It has different colors for a group of every four desktops in
   8-colors mode and the same base color in 4-color mode. Generated backdrop
   in the $FVWM_USERDIR/backer are named DeskN-<name-of-the-backdrop>.pm
   where N is the workspace (desk) number from 1-8. In such a way it is
   possible to have the same backdrop pattern on more than one desk in
   8-colors mode.

    There is an option to use the same backdrop for all desks too. User can
   add and delete custom backdrops in $FVWM_USERDIR/backdrops. First action
   with Add button and file picker, and second action with Delete button when
   particular backdrop from the list on the right of the preview is selected.
   Delete action will fail for system-pathed backdrops with appropriate error
   message, while both actions will reload list of backdrops immediately.
   Apart from doing this, NsCDE Backdrop Style Manager has couple of features
   more than CDE original:

     *   In 8-color mode, user can select another color variant instead of
       default for the current desk from the popup menu. There are four
       variants.

     *   Custom palette can be loaded instead of default one, and backdrops
       can be set with colors from that palette. In 8-colors mode, there is
       even more possibility of course.

     *   Instead of backdrops, user can opt for a background image. If option
       "Use photo or picture is selected, list of backdrops will dissapear
       and image backgrounds (so called "wallpapers") will be loaded from
       $NSCDE_ROOT/share/photos and from the $FVWM_USERDIR/photos (if any).
       Options to use one photo for all desks exists. In this mode,
       backdrop-specific options will be hidden until Use photo or picture is
       not deselected. Add and Delete of photos/pictures is supported in a
       same way as for backdrops. Photos must be in PNG or XPM format to be
       loaded.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Ctrl+Q: Quits Backdrop Style Manager.

     *  P: Applies preview of the currently selected backdrop (or photo) on
       the root window.

     *  Up/Down: Selects previous or next element on the backdrop (or photo)
       list.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Beep Style Manager

    Simple tool to adjust system beep device - if it is present as device and
   if desired/enabled. This tool uses xset(1) b command to set volume, pitch
   and duration of the beep sound. Modified setting can be tested with
   additional Beep button which is not present in the original tool, and also
   dynamically applied with Apply button. Save button will save
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Xset.conf with other xset(1) options which are executed
   during NsCDE startup.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Escape: Quits Beep Style Manager.

     *  Ctrl+Q: Quits Beep Style Manager.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Color Style Manager

    With Backdrop Style Manager, this is probably the most important theme
   tool in (Ns)CDE. This tool applies colors to the widgets, menus,
   applications and backdrops. As in CDE, it reads color information from the
   palette files in $NSCDE_ROOT/share/palettes and $FVWM_USERDIR/palettes.
   Palettes are the 16bpp color definitions (8 of them). This colors and
   border bg/fg/sel colors calculated from them are the base of the look of
   pretty much all of the things on the screen. Colors can be applied in 4 or
   8 colors mode. Most notable palettes are Broica in 8-colors mode and
   Solaris (called Default on SunOS) in 4 colors mode.

    Color Style Manager as most tools is written in FvwmScript with
   background shell helper and color calculation and generator routines.
   Visually it tries to be as much as possible similar to the original CDE,
   but since it has some new features, there are some new buttons and
   commands introduced. Tool has a list of the palettes (system + user),
   preview button which can temporary apply some palette on the current desk
   backdrop and FVWM based applications (FrontPanel, other scripts ...)

    As in Backdrop Style Manager there are Add and Delete button actions.
   System palettes cannot be deleted, while local can be added to
   $FVWM_USERDIR/palettes and applied immediately.

    There are 8 spaces with colors from the currently selected palette (4
   spaces in 4-color mode) and generated XPM file with all 40 colors
   displayed. Button Number of Colors calls transient window where user can
   select 4 or 8 color mode. System default on modern desktop is 8.

    What is most important new feature in Color Style Manager are integration
   options. This are:

     *   Own currently used backdrop synchronization (default)

     *   X resources in $FVWM_USERDIR/Xdefaults (default)

     *   GTK2

     *   GTK3

     *   Qt4

     *   Qt5

     *   User's $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local script if exists, called
       with the path of the applied palette and number of colors.

    The last integration is used to integrate what default widget
   integrations cannot reach. For example Gkrellm skin or some terminal
   preferences. Qt/Qt5 integration is easy, since this toolkits can use their
   GTK engine to integrate self with GTK theme. All that Color Style Manager
   has to do is to define GTK engine in ~/.config/Trolltech.conf and
   ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf for colors from the new palette to be used.

    GTK2 and GTK3 are heavy work part. Here, we are using work derived from
   one CDE theme for XFCE desktop and GTK2 + GTK3, purified and adapted for
   NsCDE (see [33]the Section called Credits). This is written in python. If
   turned on, this will produce $HOME/.themes/NsCDE directory with the theme
   for GTK2 and GTK3, and will edit $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0 and
   $HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini to put or change gtk-theme-name value.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Ctrl+Q: Quits Color Style Manager.

     *  P: Like Preview was pressed. Previews currently selected color scheme
       from the list.

     *  Up/Down: Goes one item on the color schemes list up or down.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Exec Dialog

    By default key binding for Exec Dialog is Meta (mod4) + F2, and located
   on main root menu before terminal i a "Exec" dialog. This is an input form
   for executing one-shot commands without terminal. It has options to run
   command in terminal ($[infostore.terminal]), and to remain open after
   executing commands for subsequent commands. It has it's own command
   history which can be turned back with cursor up and down keys. Escape key
   closes dialog, enter executes, Ctrl+Enter executes in default terminal
   application.

    As an example, this dialog can be used if on the current page or desk
   terminal application is not present, and only some simple command is
   needed to be quickly executed.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Escape: Quits Exec dialog

     *  Return: Performs an action like if Exec is pressed.

     *  Ctrl+Return: Performs an action like if Exec is pressed, and Execute
       in terminal checkbox is checked.

     *  Shift+Return: Performs an action like if Exec is pressed, and Leave
       this dialog open checkbox is checked.

     *  Ctrl+Shift+Return: Performs an action like if Exec is pressed,
       Execute in terminal and Leave this dialog open checkboxes are both
       checked.

     *  Up/Down: Brings back and forth command history in text dialog box

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Font Style Manager

    Font management is the area where NsCDE and CDE are probably most
   different. Font Style Manager is completely NsCDE tool to set fonts for
   usage inside FVWM and external toolkits integration (X Resources/Motif,
   GTK2, GTK3, Qt4, Qt5 ...).

    NsCDE defines 15 fonts. Five groups with three members:

     *  Normal Small

     *  Normal Medium

     *  Normal Large

     *  Bold Small

     *  Bold Medium

     *  Bold Large

     *  Italic Small

     *  Italic Medium

     *  Italic Large

     *  Monospaced Small

     *  Monospaced Medium

     *  Monospaced Large

     *  Monospaced Bold Small

     *  Monospaced Bold Medium

     *  Monospaced Bold Large

    This fonts are defined as FVWM infostore variables in
   $NSCDE_ROOT/config/NsCDE-Font-$DPI.conf and/or in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Font-$DPI.conf. Further, they are defined as CPP
   macros in $FVWM_USERDIR/Xdefaults.fontdefs which is included in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Xdefaults where it is used. GTK2 and GTK3 are also getting
   default font (Normal Medium) in their configurations if integration option
   has been selected in Font Style Manager. X resources and GTK are not
   refreshed by default, their checkboxes must be selected by the user.

    The Font Style Manager itself consists of fontsets and fonts. Fontsets
   are named complete sets of five groups of three members of fonts defined
   above. Fontsets are stored in $NSCDE_ROOT/share/fontsets and in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/fontsets. If font set is selected in Font Style Manager, 15
   fonts from the set are loaded into preview lists of the application and
   can be immediately applied or further customized before saving as
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Font-$DPI.conf. Fontsets are on the leftmost GUI list
   and inactive until button Use Selected Font Set is not clicked. Manual
   font selection contains list of XFT fonts found on the system in the
   middle list and their styles (regular, bold, italic ...) on the rightmost
   list.

    Fonts can be set for the current DPI, or custom predefined DPI can be
   set. If custom DPI is set, fonts configuration file will change in $DPI
   part of the name.

    Main font selectors are:

     *  Preview Set For Size

     *  Font Group

     *  Font Size

    First popup menu loads 5 fonts from one of the 3 sets: small, medium or
   large. Second popup determines on which font current selection is working
   (normal, bold, italic, mono, mono bold), and third popup menu sets font
   size. When Font Style Manager is started, current configuration is loaded
   and fonts selected for a preview.

    Button Default loads $NSCDE_ROOT/share/fontsets/Default_$DPI.fontset
   which can then be saved or further customized. Bottom half of the Font
   Style Manager contains preview for all fonts from the one of the three
   selected size sets.

    Checkboxes Refresh Gtk2/Gtk3, and Refresh X Resources" are integrating
   font selection with popular widgets by providing variable normal medium
   font and it's size to their configuration files. Qt4 and Qt5 should
   automatically pick Gtk fonts if GTK2 font engine is active in their
   configurations. If not, qtconfig-qt4 and qt5ct applications can be started
   and some minor changes done and undone - enough for Apply/Save to take
   effect, and then font from Gtk will be loaded for sure. Checkbox Run User
   Script will attempt to run $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/fontmgr.local if exists,
   with arguments of the new config file and current DPI. This is intended
   for user's customizations which are currently beyond NsCDE's scope of
   integrations.

    Save button will save configuration of fonts and ask user to immediately
   restart FVWM, while Save Font Set will first save configuration as a new
   fontset and then as active configuration. In that way, further experiments
   with fonts can be done by the user, but saved fontset from some good point
   can be loaded to replace current configuration. When Use Selected Font Set
   is clicked, list of the fontsets becomes active, and lists of fonts and
   their styles inactive. Once font set is clicked, it will load preview of
   all the fonts in the fontset and the same button which is now called
   Select Fonts Manually can be clicked for further customizations. Mentioned
   button will change back it's title to Use Selected Font Set. Button Close
   discards actions, and Help button will call help text (if implemented).

    Configuration of fonts can be totally reset and discarded by removing
   file $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Font-$DPI.conf and FVWM restarted.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Ctrl+Q: Quits Font Style Manager.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Keyboard Style Manager

    Keyboard Style Manager tool can be used to set (xset) 4 values:

     *  Auto Repeat on/off

     *  Start Delay (start of repeat delay)

     *  Repeat Delay

     *  Click Volume

    This values are standard xset(1) r and c subcommands and their values,
   minimal and maximal allowed values are (or should be in most cases) the
   same in GUI as they are in command line tool.

    Default button will set auto repeat to on, start rate to 512, repeat
   delay to 16 and click volume to 50.

    Apply button applies setting in runtime, while Save button writes
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Xset.conf file which is a generated xset command batch
   executed during startup.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Occupy Workspace

    This tool dialog is called from the left titlebar button menu. Or from
   Alt+Space key combination from the window context. It is exact copy of the
   same CDE dialog and it sends selected window to workspace selected from
   the list, or it can make it sticky with All Workspaces checkbox pressed
   in. One addition here is the checkbox Go With the Window; when checked,
   makes NsCDE to change a current workspace and go where window was sent. OK
   performs an action, Dismiss quits Occupy Workspace tool.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Escape: Quits Occupy Workspace without performing an action.

     *  H: Displays this help text, like Help was pressed.

     *  A: Checks All Workspaces checkbox.

     *  Return: Performs move action like OK button was pressed, without
       going to the selected workspace.

     *  Ctrl+Return: Performs move action like OK button was pressed, and
       changes active workspace to the same destination.

     *  Up/Down: Selects workspace in the up or down direction on the list.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Mouse Style Manager

    Mouse Style Manager tool manages pointer - that is, mouse settings. It's
   duties are few more than only xset(1) m command. Namely:

     *  Mouse acceleration (xset)

     *  Threshold (xset)

     *  Double-Click

     *  Handedness (xmodmap)

    Acceleration and Threshold are standard xset(1) m options and man page
   for xset(1) should be consulted.

    Handedness can be set to flip left and right mouse button functions,
   while Double Click is in fact most complex: it has test area where user
   can test double click speed (pixmap will change on double-click success),
   and this setting is changing:



     *   FVWM MenuStyle DoubleClick value ($FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf)

     *   X Resources multiClickTime resource in $FVWM_USERDIR/Xdefaults.mouse

     *   Qt/KDE settings in $HOME/.kde/share/config/kdeglobals (or similar
       path) if found

     *   Gtk2 ($HOME/.gtkrc-2.0) if file exists

     *   Gtk3 ($HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini) if file exists

    Double-Click value is in milliseconds in all mentioned configurations.
   Apply button applies xset and xmodmap values set in runtime, but not
   double-click settings.

    Save button saves changes in $FVWM_USERDIR/Xset.conf and all other
   optional files for widget and FVWM integration. Default button will set
   handedness for right-handed, double-click on 450, acceleration on 60, and
   threshold on 8, apply xset and xmodmap values, FVWM MenuStyle
   DoubleClickTime and will warp pointer to Save button for actions to be
   written in config files.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Escape: Quits Mouse Style Manager.

     *  Ctrl+Q: Quits Mouse Style Manager.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Power Save Manager

    This tool manages screen DPMS values. It uses standard xset(1) to set
   screen standby, suspend and off times. Values are from 0 to 65535. Standby
   time cannot be bigger than suspend and/or off time, and suspend time
   cannot be bigger than off time.

    It has a checkbox which enables or disables DPMS management at all.
   Values are written in $FVWM_USERDIR/Xset.conf.

    If $HOME/.xscreensaver is present and has DPMS options in it, they will
   be synchronized with xset dpms options written in Xset.conf. Apply button
   applies runtime (but not xscreensaver) while Save button writes
   configuration file and $HOME/.xscreensaver DPMS settings if this file
   exists. Default button will set the following defaults: DPMS on, standby
   1200 seconds, suspend 1800 seconds, and off time 2400 seconds, apply this
   settings on runtime, and point mouse to Save button for changes to be
   written.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Subpanel Manager

    Only in NsCDE. Tool written for managing FvwmButtons transient Subpanels
   which are opened from the Front Panel. It is called from Install Icon
   action on every Subpanel. This tool exists because FvwmButtons doesn't
   implement drag and drop, and there is no application manager present,
   since this part of CDE functions cannot be easy implemented even if some
   file manager is taken to act as application manager.

    Subpanel Manager has a list of all applications which are providing
   system menu with it's presence (patched version of fvwm-menu-desktop is
   used in the background), and the list of applications provided in the
   current Subpanel from which tool is called by "Install Icon". This lists
   are displayed on the top of the window side by side: system menu
   applications on the left, and current Subpanel items on the right list.
   There are 3 text fields: Name, Command and Icon File. This fields are
   automatically populated when some item from mentioned lists is clicked,
   but it can also be populated manually if user wishes to add a custom
   application, Fvwm Module, Fvwm Function or other entry manually on the
   Subpanel. Special type of "Check for ..." is meant for entries which in
   command field are defining for the first command something common like
   shell, env etc. If we want to override a pointless check existance for
   this, and define other command string for checking, popdown menu option
   Check for ... can be selected, and small text field below popdown menu
   will appear, where this command can be specified. Subpanel Manager can
   also remove existing entries from the Subpanel.

    Subpanel Manager implements this helper functions for modifying and
   applying settings on new items:

     * Type (exec, module, function, other, check-for)

     * Do not check for command existence

     * Icon indicator

    To place some new application from the left (all applications) list in
   exact place on the subpanel, select an existing entry on the subpanel
   (right) list. When left arrow button is clicked, new application will
   appear on the list exactly below that one which has been previously
   selected, otherwise, default is to place new entries as second entry on
   the subpanel's list of applications.

    Click on the icon indicator will open simple file browser which can be
   used to find, see as preview, and set icon for manual entries which are
   not part of the applications list, or an alternative icon for program from
   applications list. Apply button regenerates subpanel, while Save button
   does this and also quits Subpanel Manager.

    Subpanels configuration file Subpanels.actions, can be edited by hand in
   $FVWM_USERDIR if something needs to be changed on existing entries. If
   editing by hand, $NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/generate_subpanels must be used to
   generate FVWM configuration output which must be redirected into
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Subpanels.conf.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Escape: Quits Subpanel Manager.

     *  Ctrl+Q: Quits Subpanel Manager.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Subpanel Settings

    A small helper dialog with functions to change display name of the
   subpanel, width of the subpanel if titles require wider (or short ones
   narrower) panel frame, end enabled/disabled state of the subpanel. Button
   Reset will erase user configuration and load system default one for given
   subpanel. Name, width and enablement all have their own Default button
   right of the text field. If pressed, it will load system defaults for
   name, width and subpanel's enablement state. All buttons are doing in
   memory changes until OK is pressed, except Reset button which acts
   immediately. Close button closes dialog without changes except if Reset
   has been pressed. This dialog is called from subpanel menu which can be
   popped with the left (and only) button on subpanel's titlebar. It is
   called Subpanel Settings. It reloads configuration of the given subpanel
   after applying changes and exiting with OK.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Escape: Quits Subpanel Settings.

     *  Ctrl+Q: Quits Subpanel Settings.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  System Action Dialog

     This is the login/logout form with the possibilities to reboot or
   shutdown the system, or change X session. It has also options for
   suspend/sleep (S3), hybrid suspend, and hibernation of the system. Of
   course, reboot, shutdown, pm-suspend, pm-hybrid-suspend and pm-hibernate
   will work only if sudo entries are configured properly. While System
   Action Dialog is active, root cursor changes to line-crossed cursor which
   is dismissed after the action is performed or dialog action dismissed. In
   $NSCDE_ROOT/share/doc/examples/sudo, one can find example which can be put
   in /etc/sudoers.d with little changes. Confirm button applies, Dismiss
   cancels and closes the dialog.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Escape: Quits System Action Dialog without performing any action.

     *  Ctrl+Q: Same as Escape

     *  Ctrl+Return: Performs an action as if Confirm is pressed.

     *  Up/Down: Changes between 7 possible options of System Action Dialog's
       popup menu.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Sysinfo

     Copy of the Sun Solaris Workstation Information info dialog. It doesn't
   have any functions apart close (Dismiss) button. It's role is
   informational. It displays current username, hostname, machine and CPU
   architecture type. IP address, hostid, network (NIS, NISPLUS, LDAP ...)
   domain name, internet domain name, size of the physical RAM, swap size,
   swap usage (as progressbar), operating system long name, and then version
   of the FVWM and version of the NsCDE. Last it shows time when system was
   last booted. This dialog can be found on the System or fourth Subpanel of
   the Front Panel in default configuration, under the entry Workstation
   Info. In the context of it's window, keys Escape, Return and Q will close
   a window.

  Window Style Manager

      In the beginning, this GUI tool has been exact copy of the CDE
     [34]Window Style Manager. In a way, this was bad. While providing exact
     copy of the same named CDE tool. It was ignoring the fact we are using
     FVWM as a WM and framework for NsCDE, and FVWM has couple hundred more
     options, and it is tens times more powerful than CDE's dtwm, and
     probably the main reason for combining CDE look and (partially) feel of
     CDE with powerful new functionalities which are provided by FVWM and
     some 3rd party programs.

      On the other hand, writing a tool that will handle ALL fvwm options and
     write that in FvwmScript which not much a powerful language can easily
     contain tens of thousands lines of code, and yet be buggy and probably
     some things will be impossible to do. Even then, it will be burden for
     users to use and almost completely avoided.

      A middle solution was provided: all from CDE original dialog, plus some
     similar extended FVWM options, on the first tab, and other important
     configurations on the rest three tabs. Tabs are implemented as popup
     menu on the top right side of the window - choosing an option from that
     menu changes displayed options - a poor man's tabs in a way. Some of
     options provided by [35]Window Style Manager are not full set of this
     options if configured manually in FVWM configuration, but for needs of
     CDE clone this is more than enough.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Configuration Section: Window Behavior



     *   Only Pointer Inside Window Makes Focus: this configures so called
       MouseFocus as catch-all FVWM Style (*). See fvwm(1) for MouseFocus.

     *   Point In Window To Make Active: this is FVWM SloppyFocus Style
       option. This is default focus style. If you want more CDE behavior,
       select MouseFocus option above. In SloppyFocus mode, pointer will make
       focus on window while entering it, but will not lose focus while
       leaving the window. See fvwm(1) for SloppyFocus.

     *   Click In Window To Make Active: self-explanatory. This is FVWM's
       ClickToFocus style.

     *   Raise Window When Made Active: self explanatory. If selected,
       focused window will be raised. This option will enable FvwmAuto module
       instance with -mfocus option. See fvwm(1) and FvwmAuto(1).

     *   Allow Primary Windows On Top: this will allow window to lower it's
       transient windows (popups and such). See fvwm(1) for RaiseTransient
       and DontRaiseTransient styles.

     *   Lower Transient With Primary Window: self explanatory. See fvwm(1)
       for LowerTransient and DontLowerTransient

     *   Raise/Lower Primaries With Transients: if transient windows are
       raised or lowered, primary windows goes with them. See fvwm(1) for
       StackTransientParent and DontStackTransientParent style options.

     *   Show Contents During Move: weather window contents is visible or not
       during window move. Default is a transparent frame with a grid. See
       fvwm(1) for OpaqueMoveSize.

     *   Time After Which Active Window Is Raised: if Raise Window When Made
       Active is turned on, this option will be enabled and time in
       milliseconds can be set here. See FvwmAuto(1).

     *   Manual Window Movement Threshold: see fvwm(1) for a MoveThreshold
       option. 5 pixels is the default.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Configuration Section: Window Icons



     *   Use Icon Box: if this option is selected, main FVWM configuration in
       NsCDE-Main.conf will spawn FvwmIconBox configured as close as possible
       as an alternative to icons of iconified windows. Classic icons will be
       disabled. The rest of options in this "tab" will be disabled because
       they do not apply anymore in this configuration. Note: FvwmIconBox has
       not exactly the same functionality as CDE's Icon Box.

     *   Place On Workspace: default. Icons of the windows will be placed on
       the screen. By default, from top left to the direction bottom left.

     *   Place Icons Left/Right from Bottom/Top to Top/Bottom: this four
       exclusive options will direct icon placement on the screen. See
       IconBox and IconFill options in fvwm(1) for more information.

     *   Default Icon Size: in pixels. See IconSize in fvwm(1).

     *   Maximum Icon Size: in pixels. See IconSIze in fvwm(1).

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Configuration Section: Page Edges



     *   Raise Front Panel On Page Change: as is says, when current active
       page changes, Front Panel will be raised.

     *   Pager Preview On Page Change: on page change, spawn a small
       transient FVWM pager called LocalPager on the top center of the screen
       to indicate what is on the current desk - this is controlled by the
       infostore variable in the $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf

     *   Disable Page Change On Screen Edge: if selected, current page will
       not change when pointer is longer time on the screen edge. In this
       mode, active page must be changed by other means (keyboard shortcuts,
       WSM submenus, PGM, left click on 1st titlebar button ...)

     *   Page Change On Screen Edge (1px): default internal detector of the
       screen edge. Do not change this if it is working.

     *   Page Change On Screen Edge (2px) If FVWM has a problem with X server
       and page change does not work smooth, use this option as a safe
       alternative. See fvwm(1).

     *   Page Edge Resistance: how many milliseconds FVWM waits on the screen
       edge area for an page change action to be taken. Default is 380.

     *   Edge Window Move Resistance: similar as Page Edge Resistance, but
       for move operation - how hard it should be to move a window between
       pages. Defaults to 80 pixels.

     *   Edge Window Move Delay: time to wait to consider moved window for
       page change in the first place (to start counting pixels of the Edge
       Window Move Resistance). Defaults to 320 pixels.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Configuration Section: Animation

    This tab controls behavior of the FvwmAnimate. See FvwmAnimate(1).

     *   Animate Window Iconification: on/off of the FvwmAnimate module.

     *   Animation Effect: See FvwmAnimate(1)

     *   Animation Frame Delay: See FvwmAnimate(1)

     *   Animation Revolution Twist: See FvwmAnimate(1)

     *   Outline Width: See FvwmAnimate(1)

     *   Animation Iterations: See FvwmAnimate(1), be careful on virtual
       displays with a bad video driver. It can behave really slower than on
       host system with the same parameters.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Misc Window Style Manager Functions

    Button Default on the top right edge of the window will read system
   defaults into options and they will be set in permanent configuration if
   OK button is pressed afterwards.

    OK button applies changes to $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf. Dismiss button
   will close the window without making any changes.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Escape: Quits Window Style Manager.

     *  Ctrl+Q: Quits Window Style Manager.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Workspaces and Pages Manager (WsPgMgr)

    This tool is specific to NsCDE. It configures three things:

     *  Number of virtual desktops

     *   Names of virtual desktops

     *   Number of virtual pages

    This graphical tool writes files $FVWM_USERDIR/WSM.conf and
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf. On the top of the window is graphical
   representation of the Workspace Manager. Every button when clicked becomes
   editable and it's name can be changed (pres return on the text field after
   writing new name). This change will be written immediately WITHOUT
   pressing OK button. Name of the desk will be changed across all NsCDE and
   FVWM (WSM, Occupy Workspace, menus etc) after window manager restart is
   triggered with OK button. In NsCDE, there are 4 options for desks: 2, 4, 6
   and 8 desks. FVWM itself supports infinite number, but in NsCDE care must
   be taken about presentation of this desks in various applets and tools.
   Nevertheless, theoretically even in NsCDE with maximum number of desks
   multiplied with maximum number of pages, user can get 128 work spaces
   which is probably enough (too much) for 99% of the people.

    Number of vertical and horizontal pages can also be configured here. This
   change will affect Page Manager (PGM), and menus which are displaying
   pages. Page names are not configurable via GUI. User is encouraged to open
   $FVWM_USERDIR/WSM.conf and edit to suit.

    OK button saves configuration, restarts window manager and quits. Cancel
   button discards, except if new names of desks are set, because this is
   written immediately, but window manager is not restarted. Workspaces and
   Pages Manager is called from the Front Panel's small left button menu
   which is called when that button is clicked with the right pointer button.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Escape: Quits Workspaces and Pages Manager.

     *  Ctrl+Q: Quits Workspaces and Pages Manager.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Helper Dialogs

  ActionForm - FvwmScript

    Dialog which uses custom text and asks user for action. Action is then
   executed (OK) or aborted (Dismiss). Example of usage is restart dialog.
   Application must provide in argument vector question text, title text,
   buttons text, and buttons actions when calling this dialog.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ChoiceForm - FvwmScript

    Similar as ActionForm, but button actions are not provided in command
   line, but signal about chosen action is sent to the calling program
   ("father" FvwmScript usually). Used only in [36]Font Style Manager for
   now.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FilePicker - FvwmScript

    A simple file pick open/save dialog. Copy of FVWM file picker, but with
   added option to display a file if file is an icon. It is a simple file
   browser with up and home shortcuts, path view and show/hide button for
   hidden (files starting with a dot) files.

    Used in [37]Backdrop Style Manager, Subpanel Manager, and [38]Color Style
   Manager for adding backdrops, photos, icons and palettes.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  InputForm - FvwmScript

    Form with text field which asks user to name something. If OK is pressed,
   string is sent to the parent script for further processing. Used in
   [39]Font Style Manager.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  WaitNotice - FvwmScript

    Short lived simple FvwmScript form, butonless and with a 3 slots for
   text. This dialog serves as short information if some NsCDE action is
   started which is not immediately obvious in a 1-2 seconds. It will appear
   in the middle of the screen with a bigger font and relief text and live
   between half of the second till 5 seconds. Depending with which text and
   duration time it was called by some function or other FvwmScript program.
   If clicked or receives return or escape key, it will dissapear
   immediately.

    Used by [40]Color Style Manager, SysActionDialog and a documetation view
   function f_DisplayURL.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NColorsDialog - FvwmScript

    A [41]Color Style Manager part

    Helper dialog to select 4, 8 or default color scheme in [42]Color Style
   Manager. It changes number of colors while browsing, previewing or
   choosing a color theme.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Escape: Quits Dialog.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  PaletteDialog - FvwmScript

    A [43]Backdrop Style Manager part

    Helper dialog which provides a list of palettes to the [44]Backdrop Style
   Manager when user wants to use color schemes from another palette from
   currently used in user's setup. This is NsCDE addon functionality, not
   present in original CDE. Additionally, background variants from custom
   palettes can be used too as from the default user's palette in 8-color
   mode, which is also NsCDE feature not present in original CDE.

    Key Bindings:

     *  Escape: Quits Dialog.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Backdrops, Palettes and Fonts

    Together with Workspace Manager, Backdrops and Palettes are probably most
   known things in CDE by which it is visually recognized.

    Backdrops, as many probably know are relatively simple XPM textures and
   pictures consisting usualy from 2-5 base colors: background, foreground,
   selectColor, topShadowColor, and bottomShadowColor. This colors are taken
   from the current (or custom) palette and applied to the symbolic
   definition of colors in XPM templates. Backdrop is then generated, tiled
   and applied to the root window. Every desk can have it's own backdrop
   texture. In 4 colors mode of the palette theme, they are all colored in
   the same pattern, while in 8 colors mode, every desk from 1-4 has it's own
   color variant from the current palette. If there are more that four desks
   defined, fifth is repeated color of the first, sixth of the second and so
   on.

    Here, in addition to original CDE textures, there are some 100 new and
   custom textures created from (free and public) textures which were
   convenient for this customization. In other words, NsCDE implements more
   than 100 backdrops, and with Backdrop Style Manager user can import to
   it's $FVWM_USERDIR/backdrops it's own backdrops, or put them there with
   terminal or file manager.

    Backdrops must have alternative extension for X Pixmaps: that is, not
   .xpm, but .pm.

    If one wants their custom backdrop to be dynamic with palette/theme of
   NsCDE, one must edit them to set symbolic names of the colors described
   above. See existing backdrops to get an idea. Apart from symbolic names,
   backdrops also have a real color defined to be compatible with XPM
   specification, but values of this colors can be arbitrary, since they are
   not used if symbolic name on the same line is set.

    Default backdrops are set from the $NSCDE_ROOT/share/defaults/backer
   until user does not redefine/set his own with [45]Backdrop Style Manager.
   Default palette is Broica in 8 colors variant.

    Backdrops generated by [46]Backdrop Style manager are put in user's
   $FVWM_USERDIR/backer/DeskN-<backdropname>.pm and defined in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Backdrops.conf as colorsets of TiledPixmap type. NsCDE
   reserved FVWM colorsets numbers for backdrops are from 31-38 for all eight
   possible desktops. This file is read by FvwmBacker(1) FVWM module. It is
   automatically generated when user makes first change with [47]Backdrop
   Style Manager.

    Until then, file $NSCDE_ROOT/config/NsCDE-Backdrops.conf is read, which
   itself reads pre-generated and pre-defined backdrops from the
   $NSCDE_ROOT/share/defaults/backer directory.

    We can conclude that backdrops are source form or template file, and when
   processed with color values from the palette, this backdrop's final form
   is, ready to be set by FvwmBacker(1).

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration files explained

      As pointed above, NsCDE has a quite complex set of configuration files.
     ~ 90% of them are the FVWM configurations. But, this system of
     configurations is arranged in some logical and consistent way. For
     example, keyboard shortcuts in NsCDE-Keybindings.conf, FvwmBacker
     configuration in NsCDE-Backer.conf, (generated) colorsets in
     NsCDE-Colorset.conf etc.

      All this configurations are included from the NsCDE-Main.conf. This is
     the starting FVWM configuration which sets core options and safe
     defaults, and reads the rest of the configuration files which are
     included there. It defines StartFunction which starts all additional
     modules and calls important things during start or restart of the Window
     Manager. System Wide configuration files are located in
     $NSCDE_ROOT/config, while user local hooks or user complete overrides
     are in $FVWM_USERDIR.

    This is default list of system-wide configurations:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FrontPanel.actions

    This is not a FVWM file. Lines in this file are default actions and icons
   for Front Panel. This file is parsed from the fpexec and fpseticon shell
   scripts. All or individual entries from this file can be overridden by
   creating $FVWM_USERDIR/FrontPanel.actions file. This is a CSV-like file
   (comma is a field separator), and it defines main 10 buttons of the Front
   Panel, their actions and icons.

    File format is:

     * Button Number (Btn1, Btn2, BtnN ...)

     * Icon path (FVWM relative from ImagePath)

     * Mouse Button (3 mouse buttons for 3 different actions if needed)

     * Program executable to check for or NOCHK for check avoidance

     * Actions (commands) with options and arguments to the end of the line

    After editing this file (system-wide or user's) nothing needs to be
   reloaded because file is read from the f_FrontPanelAction function on
   every click on every icon on the Front Panel. There is no GUI tool for
   managing this file yet.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Animate.conf

    FVWM Animate Module configuration. Animate module is started by NsCDE by
   default automatically, but with None as a default effect. This can be
   reconfigured by the user in private $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Animate.conf (or
   .local) with editor or with Window Style Manager. None effect is choosen
   as default for increased CDE similarity, because CDE doesn't have
   iconification animation effects.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Auto.conf

    Configuration of the FvwmAuto module and provided is a private set of
   FVWM functions from which only f_AutoHide (and parent functions) are used
   currently. FvwmAuto is started by NsCDE by default i -menter mode from
   NsCDE-Main.conf. Currently used to autoraise and autohide Front Panel, no
   matter which focus style is selected by default. In that way, Front Panel
   is not in the way of applications, yet on mousover action it is raised and
   lowered when it is not in focus and not use. FvwmAuto can be used to
   autoshade or autoiconify Front Panel and much more. See FvwmAuto(1).

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Backdrops.conf

    This file defines 8 colorsets for all (maximal) 8 desktops as a
   TiledPixmap colorset type. In the system configuration, static
   non-generated configuration defines pre-generated default backdrops of
   default Broica color scheme. When user makes the first change with
   [48]Backdrop Style Manager, user's private copy of this file is created in
   $FVWM_USERDIR. In NsCDE, colorsets 31 - 38 are reserved for backdrops (or
   png, xpm photos).

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Backer.conf

    Rarely needed in $FVWM_USERDIR. FvwmBacker(1) configuration which defines
   8 maximum desks and refers them to 8 colorsets from 31 - 38. Option
   RetainPixmap is defined in case user wants to use X compositor such as
   compton(1) with NsCDE.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Banner.conf

    FvwmBanner(1) configuration. Displays logo during login.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Colorset.conf

    Definition of all colorsets minus colorsets 31 - 38 which are reserved
   for the backdrops. System-wide file has predefined color values for
   default color scheme (Broica), while user's file in $FVWM_USERDIR is
   created on first change made with [49]Color Style Manager. Apart from FVWM
   colorsets, this file exports in environment two variables: NSCDE_PALETTE
   with the name of the color palette used in generation of the file, and
   NSCDE_PALETTE_NCOLORS which is either 4 or 8, depending which color
   variant has been used in [50]Color Style Manager.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE.conf

    This file defines various FVWM and NsCDE defaults. System wide
   configuration are static defaults which can be loaded by [51]Window Style
   Manager or by erasing user's copy of the file. User's copy of the
   NsCDE.conf contains all options (minus FvwmAnimate) from [52]Window Style
   Manager's set of options, but it has some options such as FVWM infostore
   variables for default terminal and file manager applications, graphical
   editor, and such. Infostore variables desknum, pagematrixX and pagematrixY
   are managed by the Workspace and Pages Manager while menudclicktm
   infostore variable is managed by the Pointer Style Manager. In NsCDE.conf,
   defaults for page edges, focus, icons, and such are defined. See [53]the
   Section called Window Style Manager and fvwm(1) for details. Since this is
   read by FVWM, user can set in this file local variables and additional
   configuration options if needful, which are not covered in other parts of
   the configuration. While applications are taking great care with long
   regexp lines to parse and write this file, if edited manually, user is
   advised to keep it clean: use proper capitalization as it is described in
   fvwm(1), without line breaks and if possible, surplus spaces and tabs.
   Comments are allowed as usual: as lines which begins with # sign.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Event.conf

    FvwmEvent(1) module configuration. In this file a single instance of the
   FvwmEvent called MainLoop is defined. It passes ID (Window ID, desk etc
   ... depending on context) for window manager actions. Cmd option is empty:
   FVWM functions are used for all defined actions. Currently, actions
   new_desk, new_page, add_window and focus_change are observed and their
   respective functions from NsCDE-Functions.conf are triggered. This serves
   Workspace Manager, Page Manager (PGM) and window placement functions in an
   important way. If redefined or disabled, things will start to break. It
   can be extended by the user to suit the needs, but here also care must be
   taken, because complex functions, or calling slow and/or resource hungry
   commands from that functions can make FVWM (and hence NsCDE) dramatically
   slow.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Font-$DPIdpi.conf

    ... where $DPI is either 120, 144, 75 or 96.

    This files are static when system wide, but generated by [54]Font Style
   Manager in $FVWM_USERDIR. Every X server's DPI state selects and reads one
   of this files - the one which exactly or approximately matches current DPI
   in this order:

     * if DPI is <= 85, $DPI is 75

     * if DPI is > 85 and < 108, $DPI is 96

     * if DPI is >= 108 and < 132, $DPI is 120

     * if DPI is >= 132, $DPI is 144

    Font sizes in configs are defined as infostore variables and used across
   FVWM config files, an provided to FvwmScript programs with getfont
   wrapper. Font sizes are in points. While defining them in pixels
   (pixelsize=) will be easier, and all this care about DPI will not be
   needed, integration with GTK2 and GTK3 in best of my knowledge and
   research does not provide a way to define fonts in pixel sizes, so either
   font sizes in points or unsure recalculation (again based on DPI) will be
   needed while writing gtk settings.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Form.conf

    Definitions of few FVWM forms. FvwmForm is reading this. This are simple
   popups and dialogs used in FvwmScripts and in part of the configuration.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-FrontPanel.conf

    Main NsCDE Front Panel configuration file. Here, FvwmButtons is
   configured under the alias *FrontPanel. Special care is taken to place
   most of configurable parts out of this file, so it doesn't have to be
   forked into $FVWM_USERDIR, but this option nevertheless exists. Here, all
   geometry, buttons, subpanels, default icons, frames and widgets are
   written and put in place. This configuration, together with swallowed WSM
   (Workspace Manager) is probably the most recognizable part of the setup
   which provides us with familiar and so wanted CDE look - a Front Panel.
   FvwButtons FrontPanel configuration is non-trivial, but it is very
   trustworthy mimicking the original. Icon actions which user wants to
   change here can be overridden with FrontPanel.actions file and Subpanels
   which are also described here. Swallowed apps and "widgets" are in most
   part already described in sections above.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Functions.conf

    Another important part of the configuration. Almost all FVWM functions
   are defined here, except 2-3 of core functions in NsCDE-Main.conf which
   are reading the rest of the configuration. They are sorted in logical
   groups and are used widely in almost every part of the configuration, and
   particularly from the FvwmScript scripts. Main groups of NsCDE FVWM
   functions are:

     * Core Window Operation Functions

     * Front Panel functions

     * Misc core functions

     * Functions called from FvwmEvent MainLoop

     * Functions for generating menus

     * Placeholders for functions aimed for user to override

     * Functions used in NsCDE FvwmScripts

    For a FVWM function description see fvwm(1), in this file there is a
   plethora of examples, and for user usage is the most interesting part
   placeholders for functions which are here merely for programs to not
   complain about missing them and which should be overridden in user's local
   extension $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Functions.local - this extension file will
   be read by the main configuration immediately after processing
   NSCDE-Functions.conf. This functions are:

     *   f_CheckMail: called by CheckMailApplet on the FrontPanel on click
       and periodically. This is the place where some script can be called
       and with SendToModule to "1 1" (widget 1, routine 1) icon of empty
       mailbox will be changed to the icon of the full mailbox.

     *   f_Calendar: called by MonthDayApplet on click. Can be used to call
       external calendar application, to focus Thunderbird with lightning
       extension or whatever user finds useful.

     *   f_Mixer: unused currently.

     *   f_AddCustomToRootMenu: add custom entries in a convenient point of
       the root menu which is called by the right mouse button on the root
       window.

     *   f_UserChangeDesk: called when current active desk changes

     *   f_UserChangePage: called when current active page changes

    Another useful function is conditional execution function f_WarpOrExec.
   It takes 3+ arguments. First is the window name or class (or icon,
   resource) name, second is the binary to check in $PATH>, and 3rd to the
   rest of the command line is what to execute with all arguments included.
   If window with name from arg1 is already present on $DISPLAY, it will not
   be executed, but pointer will be simply pointed to that window. If window
   was iconified, or function called from another desk or page, window will
   be deiconified, and desk and/or current page changed to one where existing
   window is residing.

    Care must be taken if this file is overridden by the local copy of the
   conf (not local) file, because a lot of things depends on this functions.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-IconMan.conf

    If Use Icon Box option is selected in the [55]Window Style Manager,
   infostore variable iconbox will be defined as non-zero, and FvwmIconMan(1)
   module will be started on login from the NsCDE-Main.conf. This file,
   NsCDE-IconMan.conf contains default configuration of that module.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Ident.conf

    Module FvwmIdent(1) is called either from a small menu which can be
   popped up with middle pointer click on a titlebar, or from the root window
   version of the Window Options menu. This is FvwmIdent's configuration
   file. It simply defines colorset and font for the FvwmIdent's window.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Init.conf

    Most probable candidate for copying to $FVWM_USERDIR. Here are defined
   start, quit and restart function (sessionless and session-managed) which
   are internally recognized by FVWM during certain important actions.
   InitFunction or SessionInitFunction is the place to put all user wants to
   be executed during NsCDE startup. In system-wide default configuration
   there are already conditionally defined some probable applications and
   there are hints and examples for user to customize this further.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Keybindings.conf

    For CDE clone and CDE compatibility, key bindings are a bit problematic
   area. In my local installation of open sourced CDE in virtual machine with
   CentOS 7, (didn't bothered to install Solaris 10 to examine their flavor
   again), key bindings are almost non-existent. Alt+F4 usually closes the
   window and that's it. Because of this fact, and because NsCDE is not only
   a visual clone of the CDE, but it aims to provide more functionality and
   to be useful daily driver for user to enjoy in familiar look and feel
   (hated by a lot of people) and to be seriously productive in the same
   time, comfortable and quick, to have good graphic (such as anti-aliased
   fonts, but this also can be turned off), a set of useful key bindings is
   defined by default. This default keybindings set can be extended,
   partially overridden, or completely replaced (copy the
   NsCDE-Keybinding.conf in $FVWM_USERDIR and edit, or even write from
   scratch). Defaults are author's daily driver. For explanation what is the
   context, and what modifier, see FVWM explanation (copied from original
   default FVWM config and extended a bit). Namely:

  Keymenu.actions

    This file is not FVWM configuration file. It is written [56]Subpanel
   Settings, or manually with editor, and read by the
   $NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/keymenu command which will generate infostore
   variables with descriptive keyboard shortcut names which are used in NsCDE
   menus from NsCDE-Menus.conf and NsCDE-Functions.conf, and additionaly, use
   the whole line after the keyword in the first column with "Silent Key"
   prefix to dinamically generate this part of keybindings which are
   separated from NsCDE-Keybindings.conf and processed specially because they
   definition must automatically match keyboard binding description in
   various menus.

    The syntax of this file is simple: first column is the keyword which
   becomes infostore variable (km_xrefresh as $[infostore.km_xrefresh]), and
   the rest columns of every line is FVWM "Key" sintax which is paired with
   "Silent Key" prefix during initialization with f_KeyMenu -a from
   NsCDE-Main.conf.

    Every line, or dynamic keybinding can be overriden here if (re)defined in
   user's $FVWM_USERDIR/Keymeu.actions: whole file or just choosen
   keybindings. The goal is to get their descriptions (after functions and
   menus reload) automatically in place on menus. For example, "F3 A M"
   configuration for FVWM "Key" will become Alt+F3 description right of the
   (De)Shade item on titlebar left button popdown menu.

    File Keymenu.actions is processed by $NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/keymenu script.
   This script generates FVWM infostore variables used in menus, and executes
   FVWM "Key" commands producing dynamic keybindings which are described in
   menus.

    For a list of keybindings that are "dynamic", that is, not defined in
   NsCDE-Keybindings.conf, but in Keymenu.actions, see notices in section
   about [57]NsCDE-Keybindings.conf.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Main.conf

     Core configuration. This file is read the first upon starting FVWM
   Window Manager. In fact, FVWM is invoked with -f /path/to/NsCDE-Main.conf
   to read it instead of default FVWM system configuration or user's
   ~/.fvwm/config. This invocation and configuration in NsCDE-Main.conf
   changes everything. It avoids ~/.fvwm if user has a plain (normal) FVWM
   setup, defines and redefines FVWM internal variables and sets NSCDE_ROOT,
   configures some core FVWM options (like DefaultIcon), defines main FVWM
   Read command wrapper f_ReadCfg, sets desktop names, reads NsCDE.conf
   depending if user has it, or system-wide one, defines StartFunction,
   DesktopSize, and then reads most of the files described in this documents,
   composing NsCDE FVWM configuration. Care must be taken NOT to read this
   file with f_ReadCfg, because it will end up in the endless CPU hogging
   loop because f_ReadCfg will be destroyed and recreated during it's own
   execution. This file should probably never be overridden in $FVWM_USERDIR.
   It is the init(8) of the NsCDE system.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Menus.conf

    In NsCDE, there is a bunch of the menus. Root menus, contextual menus,
   and even menus called or dinamically generated from FvwmScript(1).

     *   MenuFvwmRoot built-in root menu of FVWM. As in CDE, menu of such
       type, it is called with a right click on the root window.

     *   m_Applications - main and dynamically generated menu with a python
       script nscde-fvwm-menu-desktop which is a modified version of the
       fvwm-menu-desktop (contains flat list of apps and icons for Front
       Panel's subpanels). It reads /etc/xdg/menus/<desk>-applications.menu

     *   m_QuickMenu beneath m_Applications. Empty by default. Intended to be
       destroyed and recreated by the user (NsCDE-Menus.local) with own
       favorites.

     *   m_NsCDEHelpMenu beneath Quick Menu. Contains links to this
       documentation in PDF and HTML forms.

     *   m_NsCDEMenu on the top of generated Applications menu. Contains
       entries to various the NsCDE internal tools. in PDF and HTML forms.

     *   m_MoveToPage: invoked from the 1st titlebar button. Moves window to
       the specified page on desk

     *   m_MoveToWorkspace: as m_MoveToPage, but moves across desks. Invoked
       with middle pointer on the 1st titlebar button

     *   m_ControlFrontPanelMenu: Front Panel specific functions. Invoked
       from the left top control panel menu button on right pointer click

     *   m_DeiconifyOnPage: submenu of the main icon menu invoked with the
       1st pointer click on desktop icon, deiconify window on another page

     *   m_FrontPanelWinMenu: Front Panel flavor of the Window Operations
       menu. Invoked from the top left menu button of the Front Panel

     *   m_IconM2: calls small menu with FvwmIdent, xwininfo and xprop if
       icon is clicked with a middle pointer button

     *   m_IconOps: main icon menu invoked with a click on the icon. Contains
       Icon flavor of the "Window Operations" menu, submenus (see above) and
       deiconify action

     *   m_SubpanelWindowOps: a Subpanel flavor of the Window Operations
       menu. Invoked from the Subpanel's titlebar left (and only) button
       contains also contextual actions Refresh Subpanel and Subpanel
       Settings

     *   m_TitleBarM2: Middle pointer click on titlebar. Invokes a small menu
       which gives FvwmIdent, xwininfo, xprop, and two types of screenshot of
       the window.

     *   m_WindowOps: main menu of Window Operations invoked with a mouse
       click on left titlebar button. It has extended (More ...) and reduced
       (Less ...) version.

     *   m_WindowOpsMore: changes m_WindowOps from default reduced, to
       extended view (More ... option on Window Operation menu)

     *   m_WindowOpsRootWin: Standalone root window version of the Window
       Operations menu. Invoked with a click on the root window.

     *   m_WindowOpsXterm: extensions for the Window Operations menu
       activated on (recognized) terminal application windows.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Mousebindings.conf

     File NsCDE-Mousebindings.conf is done in similar manner as the
   NsCDE-Keybindings.conf. Can be overridden (.conf) or extended (.local)
   just like (almost) any NsCDE conf file. See fvwm(1) for "Mouse" commands.
   Here commands invoked with pointer are defined. As it is the case with key
   bindings, mouse actions are too far more in NsCDE than in original CDE.
   The syntax is described at the top of the file.

     Actions are:

     *   Titlebar 1st (left) button left click: invokes Window Operations
       menu, double click closes (Delete) a window

     *   Titlebar 1st (left) button middle click: Move to Workspace menu
       double click closes (Close) a window

     *   Titlebar 1st (left) button right click: Move to Page menu double
       click closes (Destroy) a window

     *   Titlebar 2nd (right) button left click: Iconify Window

     *   Titlebar 2nd (right) button middle click: No Operation

     *   Titlebar 2nd (right) button right click: Shade (Roll up/down) Window

     *   Titlebar 3rd (rightmost) button left click: (Un)Maximize Window 82%
       double click (un)maximizes 100%, covering Front Panel and it's area

     *   Titlebar 3rd (rightmost) button middle click: (Un)Maximizes 82% and
       makes window sticky or unsticks it depending on window's initial state

     *   Titlebar 3rd (rightmost) button right click: (Un)Maximizes 82% and
       makes window raise or lower depending on window's initial state

     *   Titlebar left click: Moves window on move, raises/lowers on click

     *   Titlebar middle click: pops up menu with functions to take a
       screenshot of the window, identify with info (FvwmIdent), xprop(1),
       and xwininfo(1)

     *   Titlebar right mouse button quickly raises or lowers a window

     *   Pointer actions 4 and 5 (mouse wheel) are shading and unshading
       (rollup, rolldown) a window

     *   Left pointer click on border or corner raises or lowers a window
       while move action will interactively resize the window

     *   Middle pointer click on border or corner will only do lower/raise
       action, without resize on pointer movement

     *   Right pointer click on border or corner also does lower/raise
       action, but on pointer movement moves the window

     *   Left pointer click in combination with control on border or corner
       calls a root window version of the Window Operations menu - this rare
       and border functionality is aimed for difficult situations where there
       is no other option easily available

     *   Middle pointer click in combination with control on border or corner
       refreshes the window

     *   Right pointer click in combination with control on border or corner
       calls root applications menu (MenuFvwmRoot) - this rare and border
       functionality is aimed for difficult situations where there is no
       other option easily available

     *   Left pointer click on icon calls m_IconOps menu, while double click
       action deiconifies a window

     *   Middle pointer click on icon calls m_IconM2 menu

     *   Right pointer click on icon directly deiconifies a window

     *   Left click on the root window calls Window Options menu

     *   Middle click calls FVWM WindowList super-menu see fvwm(1) for
       WindowList

     *   Right click calls main root menu MenuFvwmRoot

     *   Pointer actions 4 and 5 (mouse wheel) will scroll between current up
       and down desk pages by 10%

     *   Control+ middle mouse click will call extended version of the
       WindowList with additional window info such as page number and window
       geometry.

     *   Pointer actions 4 and 5 (mouse wheel) will scroll between current up
       and down desk pages by 1% if Shift is simultaneously pressed

     *   Pointer actions 4 and 5 (mouse wheel) will scroll between current up
       and down desk pages by 1% if Meta (mod4) is simultaneously pressed,
       but in opposite direction then scroll with shift

     *   Left mouse button on border of the shaded Front Panel context will
       de-shade and reposition Front Panel

     *   Right mouse button on border of Front Panel will shade or de-shade
       Front Panel

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Pager-WspLocPager.conf

    Configures FvwmPager(1) type which is called from the Page Manager (PGM)
   or as Local Pager from the right-click popup menu on Workspace Manager
   buttons. This pager is transient and will disappear after being used with
   a pointer click.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Pager-GlobalPager.conf

    Similar, but bigger FvwmPager(1), invoked as Global Pager from
   right-click popup menu on Workspace Manager buttons, or (by default) with
   Meta+Escape keybinding this pager is transient and will disappear when
   used with a pointer click.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Pager-LocalPager.conf

    Infostore variable pageraisefp in NsCDE.conf is by default 0. If enabled,
   when active page changes, visual FvwmPager(1) will be shown in the center
   of the screen near the top of it. On Ctrl+Compose (Ctrl+Menu) and/or
   Shift+ISO_Level3_Shift (Right Alt), pager will move to the position of the
   pointer, it will eventually disappear from the screen after 1 second, 3
   seconds, 5 seconds, 8 seconds, or 10 seconds if it looses the focus, or it
   can be dismissed by pressing the same key combination once more while
   pointer is above pager.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Script.conf

    Default for all FvwmScript(1) Module based applications and widgets.
   Script Path, default font and colorset. All this values are defined
   outside of this file, so nothing really should be changed here.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  WSM.conf

    Non-FVWM config file. Here, names of the desks are provided and can be
   changed manually of with Workspace Manager. Names of the desk pages (for
   the menus) are defined here too, and manager manually only for now. Option
   WSPPG can have value 0 or 1. If 1, small dynamic icon similar to the Page
   Manager (PGM) will be shown right of the desk name on the Workspace
   Manager active desk button, but only in 2 and 4 button configuration. Off
   by default, edit manually.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Style.conf

    Main decoration configuration. Style '*' is applied globally. This is the
   main source of CDE and Motif-like behavior. If user wants to preserve
   CDE-like look and feel, this options should not be changed too much.
   Otherwise, a plain FVWM configuration can be done which can drastically
   differ from NsCDE, since FVWM has much more options and variants for a
   huge number of tastes. Style '*' options are partially overridden or
   extended in NsCDE.conf which can be generated with [58]Window Style
   Manager or simply copied from $NSCDE_ROOT/config to $FVWM_USERDIR and
   edited to suit.

    Options are grouped in 5 categories:

     *   Default, or '*' styles

     *   Fvwm modules and FvwmScript(1) script specific

     *   Some basic sane defaults for common applications

     *   Menu styles (not a style commands, but styles anyway)

     *   Cursor styles (not a style commands, but styles anyway)

    This styles can be extended and/or overridden by the user's own
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Style.local.

    Colorsets and fonts used in this configuration are generated and stored
   in NsCDE-Font-$DPIdpi.conf and NsCDE-Colorset.conf.

    Man page fvwm(1) has a rich and extended description of what can be done
   with a huge set of Style commands.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Subpanels.actions

    This file is not FVWM configuration file. It is written by the
   [59]Subpanels Manager, [60]Subpanel Settings, or manually with editor, and
   read by the $NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/generate_subpanels command which will
   generate [61]NsCDE-Subpanels.conf file in user's $FVWM_USERDIR. The syntax
   of this file is simple. It is CSV-like file where values are delimited
   with a comma ",". Every line belongs to one of the ten subpanels. Comma
   and "'" characters cannot be part of the field values. This values are:

     *   S<X>: where <X> is a number from 1 to 10 indicates which subpanel's
       line is this

     *   NAME, WIDTH, ENABLED, ENTRY: second line indicates subpanel's
       display name, subpanel's width regarding font and long application
       names on the menu, state of enablement, and entries defined for this
       subpanel. ENTRY lines can be multiple (as much as screen resolution
       allows), other values must be unique for every subpanel.

     *   For NAME, WIDTH and ENABLED, there is only a third parameter: for a
       NAME the name of the subpanel, WIDTH is an integer (reasonable values:
       120 - 260), and enabled is boolean 1 or 0.

     *   For ENTRY lines, there are fields application title, check type,
       icon path and name, and command with arguments fields that must be
       defined. Title is name of the entry. For example "Firefox" or
       "Workstation Info". Check type can be one of "FVWM-M" for FVWM module,
       "FVWM-F" for FVWM function, "OTHER" (currently unused),
       CHECK:<appname> where <appname> is the command which should be checked
       for existance instead of the first string of the command field, empty
       space (nothing between commas: ,,), and NOCHK which indicates that no
       check for a command existance should be done in NsCDE-Subpanels.conf.
       Most of the entries will default to empty which will prepend Test (x
       <appname>) to the entry specification in the resulting FvwmButtons(8)
       config. Icon is full path of the icon file (32x32) which should belong
       to the application. and the rest of the line is application's calling
       command, possibly with options and arguments.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NsCDE-Subpanels.conf

    This file is generated by the $NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/generate_subpanels. It
   is static in system directory, but changable and easly generated in the
   $FVWM_USERDIR It contains FvwmButtons(8) definitions of all 10 possible
   subpanels which can be popped up from the [62]Front Panel. There are 3
   ways to regenerate this file: [63]Subpanels Manager tool called from the
   Install Icon, [64]Subpanel Settings tool called from the titlebar popdown
   menu on every subpanel as Subpanel Settings or manually by calling
   $NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/generate_subpanels which will read user's or system
   [65]Subpanels.actions for every subpanel and if it is defined in user's
   one, take this one while generating NsCDE-Subpanels.conf. In system
   default, subpanels 2, 5 and 6 are disabled by default, but can be
   activated with a very quick double middle pointer click on the empty
   launcher without arrow: a [66]Subpanel Settings application will appear on
   the screen which has a checkbox "This Subpanel is Enabled" which will be
   checked out by default, and can be checked in, and OK will enable subpanel
   with initial system defaults for name, width and application entries.

System and User NsCDE Tree Layout

    This section describes in detail what is stored where in NsCDE
   system-wide installation hierarchy, and user's home directory .NsCDE or
   $FVWM_USERDIR.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  System Tree Layout

    Everything from NsCDE is for now located as one compact place for easier
   portability between Linux and Unix systems in /opt/NsCDE. Only symlink to
   main starting wrapper /opt/NsCDE/bin/nscde is feasible to be put into
   /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, since /opt/NsCDE/bin doesn't really need tobe
   put in user's $PATH.

    This are subdirectories of /opt/NsCDE with short description what is
   what, and what is where:

     * /opt/NsCDE

        main top directory of NsCDE installation all further descriptions
       will be written as relative to this directory

     *  bin

         nscde start wrapper called from .xsession or integrated as .desktop
       file in /usr/share/xsession is located here, as well as some helper
       scripts of the NsCDE which are suitable for general use. Front Panel
       pclock is also here. Pclock is the only binary part of the NsCDE

     *   config

         Configuration directory. All .conf files described in documentation
       are here. They are read from config/NsCDE-Main.conf which is called
       from bin/nscde by fvwm binary with -f directly.

     *   lib/progbits

         Template X pixmap files used by [67]Color Style Manager for
       producing user's copy in the $FVWM_USERDIR/icons/NsCDE/ this pixmaps
       are invalid as pictures in their source form since they contain
       internal macros for replacement with real colors. System starting
       theme is using their copied in share/icons/NsCDE.

     *   lib/python

         Python libraries used by themegen.py: part of the integration suite
       for GTK and Qt.

     *   libexec

         The rest of the scripts (korn shell and python) are located here. In
       normal circumstances this scripts should not be run directly, but they
       are used by numerous NsCDE FvwmScript apps and FVWM functions as
       helpers and background program workers.

     *   share/backdrops

         Backdrop files. CDE and new, additional. Source for generation of
       active user's backdrop depending on theme, that is color scheme. They
       have .pm extension instead of .xpm. Bitmap files .bm (.xbm) are not
       supported by style managers and hence some of CDE's original backdrops
       of that type are in NsCDE converted to X pixmaps.

     *   share/cursors

         Custom cursors which are missing on plain X server installations but
       can be found in CDE. Referenced in config/NsCDE-Style.conf.

     *   share/defaults/backer

         Default generated backdrops for first start (Broica, 8 colors)
       Referenced in system's config/NsCDE-Backdrops.conf.

     *   share/defaults/pages

         Default page names for every possible combination supported by NsCDE

     *   share/doc

         Documentation

     *   share/doc/examples

        Examples for X display manager and DE integrations, sudo for shutdown
       reboot, pm-suspend or pm-hibernate, Gkrellm NsCDE skin.

     *   share/fontsets

         Default font sets used by the [68]Font Style Manager

     *   share/icons/CDE

         Original CDE icons

     *   share/icons/NsCDE

         Custom NsCDE icons of which many are part of FvwmScript programs and
       applets

     *   share/palettes

         CDE palettes plus a bunch of new custom palettes. Used by [69]Color
       Style Manager and [70]Backdrop Style Manager, as well as
       libexec/themegen.py, libexec/backdropmgr, libexec/colormgr,
       libexec/nscde_palette_colorgen.py

     *   share/photos

         A couple of nice free photos collected and resized for various
       screen resolutions. Can be used instead of backdrops (selectable from
       [71]Backdrop Style Manager) or in $HOME/.xscreensaver for some
       screensavers which are loading photos.

     *   share/templates/app-defaults

         X resources for a particular X applications (like XTerm) which are
       processed by the [72]Color Style Manager for user to be put into
       $FVWM_USERDIR/app-defaults (if enabled). Referenced by the usual
       XAPPLRESDIR environment variable.

     *   share/templates/integration/gtk2_gtk3_qt

         Part of the CDE theme which are used by libexec/themegen.py and the
       rest of lib/python/*.py to generate $HOME/.themes/NsCDE with a
       selected palette and color depth.

         share/templates also contains Xdefaults and some include files for
       it, as well as configuration for stalonetray if it is detected on
       initial setup, and BGdefault, which is a monochrome pixmap loaded as
       bare default early on start, before FvwmBacker(1) sets up backdrops on
       each user's desk.

     *   src

         Here is the patch for fvwm 2.6.7 and 2.6.8 which adds additional
       small features to fvwm, so we can achieve even more similarity between
       NsCDE and CDE. See [73]the Section called Patches for FVWM for the
       details.

     *   src/pclock-0.13.1

         Latest version of pclock. Provided as C source (plus FreeBSD 12
       binary) for non-Linux systems and Linux distributions where default
       binary cannot work (no matter how small and modest dependencies it
       has)

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  User Tree Layout

    User's configuration is located in $HOME/.NSCDE - this place is what is
   referred as $FVWM_USERDIR in this documentation. There was no need to
   redefine this variable, since it server well for NsCDE. If user has a
   plain FVWM configuration in $HOME/.fvwm it will not be touched and can
   co-exist with NsCDE in that way. Here is the simple layout of things in
   $FVWM_USERDIR:

     *   app-defaults/ directory: X resources referenced by the usual
       XAPPLRESDIR environment variable. Files inside are (will be) generated
       by the [74]Color Style Manager

     *   backdrops/ directory: If created, user can put custom backdrop
       sources here, and they can than be selected by the [75]Backdrop Style
       Manager and processed with current or custom color scheme.

     *   photos/ directory: User's photos which can be used instead of
       backdrops if selected in [76]Backdrop Style Manager or configured in
       NsCDE-Backdrops.conf manually.

     *   backer/ directory: Generated backdrops referenced by Colorsets 31-38
       for FvwmBacker

     *   fontsets/ directory: If created, user can put or generate with
       [77]Font Style Manager own fontsets here.

     *   icons/ directory: Populated by dynamic menu action
       libexec/nscde-fvwm-menu-desktop. If directory does not exist, script
       will create it.

     *   icons/NsCDE/ directory: NsCDE custom icons. Put here by [78]Color
       Style Manager and the rest of the tools. Since icons from here are
       referenced with a relative path, whatever is missing here, will be
       loaded from system's $NSCDE_ROOT/share/icons/NsCDE automatically.

     *   libexec/ directory: If created, colormgr.local script can be written
       and put here, as well as fontmgr.local and other user's hooks.

     *   palettes/ directory: User can put custom palette files here, and
       they can than be selected by the [79]Color Style Manager and processed
       for a preview or applied as new theme.

     *   templates/ directory: Here, local subdirectory of app-defaults with
       tmpl files can be optionally created. Also, it is a good choice for
       Gkrellm or other files processed by the libexec/colormgr.local

     *   tmp/ directory: Place used by parts of the NsCDE and in particular
       NsCDE's FvwmScript programs for temporary generated files for
       previews, or as scratch and work directory. Tools are usually taking
       care to cleanup their garbage from tmp/ on exit.

     *   NsCDE-XYZ.conf files: Absolute overrides of
       $NSCDE_ROOT/config/NsCDE-XYZ.conf files. If in existence, they will be
       read instead of system defaults. XYZ is here placeholder/example for
       Style, Functions, Keybindings, Init, Menus etc ...

     *   NsCDE-XYZ.local files: Extensions, added values of
       $NSCDE_ROOT/config/NsCDE-XYZ.conf files. If in existence, they will be
       read in right after their .conf main configurations from system (or
       local) directory. This is preferred way to extend functionality or
       override something not big enough for a complete "fork" of the config
       file. Colorset, Backdrops, Animate, Font-$DPIdpi, Init, and Subpanel
       are exception of this, that is, it is preferred (if not only thing
       possible) to have it as .conf files only and not .local files.

         XYZ is here placeholder/example for Style, Functions, Keybindings,
       Init, Menus etc ...

     *   NsCDE.conf: managed by [80]Window Style Manager, Workspaces and
       Pages Manager, Pointer Style Manager and users own editor manually.
       See the rest of the documentation.

     *   WSM.conf: read/written by Workspace and Page Manager, WSM and user's
       favorite editor. Not an FVWM config file. System default of this file
       is $NSCDE_ROOT/config/WSM.conf.

     *   FrontPanel.actions: user's overrides/addons for Front Panel icons
       and actions. Written by editor, that is, manually only.

     *   GeoDB.ini: part of the Geometry Manager functionality. Written and
       read by the bin/confset.py and bin/confget.py on Save Geometry" and
       Reposition Window from Window Operations menu. Windows-like ini files
       are WAY nicer than dconf and such binary registry-like facilities.

     *   Xdefaults: Read on startup by xrdb(1).

     *   Xdefaults.local, Xdefaults.fontdefs, Xdefaults.mouse: Included with
       preprocessor directives from Xdefaults

     *   Xset.conf: Configuration (a batch file or shell script basically)
       with xset(1) parameters for system beep, pointer, keyboard, and DPMS
       settings which are managed by their respective Style Managers. User
       can put here setxkbmap, xgamma and such additional X server
       configuration commands (or whatever one likes). Care must be taken not
       to mess lines beggining with #XYZMgr,xxxx till #end, since this is
       internal marker of FvwmScript's buggy WriteToFile function.

     *   NsCDE-Sandbox.conf: If exists, used only in bare sandbox mode, where
       basic functionality of the NsCDE is needed, and not full DE-like
       environment.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation Dependencies

    For NsCDE to work, essential software is FVWM Window Manager. Almost all
   is based on it. Since NsCDE is heavy user of infostore internal variables
   and other new features of FVWM, development has been done on FVWM versions
   2.6.7 and 2.6.8. At this time, this are recommended, if not mandatory
   versions of FVWM for NsCDE. Other dependencies, that is, software used by
   NsCDE is:

     *  Korn Shell 93. All shell script routines inside configuration, helper
       scripts and FvwmScript helpers are written with ksh. It is not sure if
       pdksh can be drop in replacement, but in tests on Arch Linux with mksh
       it became clear that mksh cannot replace Korn Shell. Korn Shell is
       available and it is free.

     *  Xorg utils (Fedora/CentOS RPM xorg-x11-utils) - xdpyinfo, xprop ...

     *  Util xdotool - only if FVWM is not patched with WindowName patch for
       the FvwmButtons

     *  ImageMagick - really needed.

     *  Xscreensaver - optional, but Screen Style Manager will not work
       without it. Something needs to be installed for locking the screen.

     *  cpp - C preprocessor for xrdb functionality - for X resources
       integration. Used by xrdb(1).

     *  xorg-x11-server-utils (CentOS, Fedora name) - xrdb, xset, xrefresh
       mandatory for startup, some style managers and menus.

     *  python-yaml - needed for python part of the color theme management
       and for Gtk+Qt integration.

     *  PyQt4 or possibly python-qt4, or python2-qt4. This is unfortunate
       dependency which is further dependent on Qt libraries. NsCDE tries to
       have as less as possible dependencies, specially indirect
       (dependencies of dependent dependencies of dependencies ...). Gtk/Qt
       integration is borrowed from CDEtheme Motif/CDE theme project and
       adapted for use with FVWM (instead of heavy Xfce dependency) or
       standalone engine. In part of the Theme.py code, some png pixmaps are
       cut and colored with functions from this API. With present job and
       lack of time, there was no time to do this without PyQt4 for the first
       public release.

         On CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu and probably Debian, also on FreeBSD,
       there should be no problem to install this with package manager, but
       in tests on Arch Linux, PyQt4 was obsoleted and user will have a hard
       time getting source from AUR and compiling huge bunch of Qt4
       libraries. There is possibility to replace PyQt4 with PyQt5 imports in
       code and it will work, no matter that it will segfault and core dump
       on the exit.

     *  Gtk2, Gtk3, Qt4, Qt5, qtconfig-qt4, qt5ct, qt5-qtstyleplugins
       (optional) There is a great chance this libraries and some usefull
       programs using them are already installed on user's system. If Gtk and
       Qt integration is activated in [81]Color Style Manager, there is no
       point not to have it installed.

         Notice about Qt4 and Qt5: qt4-config (or qt-config) and qt5ct:
       Although colors will be applied, for font setting to take effect,
       qtconfig-qt4 (or qtconfig) must be run, something changed back and
       forth, and then applied/saved - no matter that you will see fonts of
       your choice already selected. This can be considered a bug. Same goes
       for Qt5.

         Notice about Qt5: QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME environment variable must be
       set, and be set to qt5ct value in order to run qt5ct configurator.

     *  Recommended fonts for as close as possible CDE look are DejaVu Serif
       for variable, and DejaVu Sans Mono for monospaced fonts. Check should
       be made if this fonts are installed on the system. For Solaris CDE
       look, Lucida Sans and monospaced Lucida Sans Typewriter should be
       installed, selected and used instead. (optional)

     *  Open Motif 2 libraries for some programs, although it is not used in
       any part of the NsCDE. (optional)

     *  Stalonetray for "tray" facility (optional)

     *  xterm

     *  python3 (FVWM)

     *  python34-pyxdg or python3-pyxdg or ... (FVWM)

     *  libstroke (FVWM)

     *  perl-File-MimeInfo (on some platforms and some fvwm packages)

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation

    When FVWM and all/most above mentioned dependencies are met, NsCDE can be
   used. Present installation is very simple:

     $ su - || sudo -i
     # umask 0022
     # cd /tmp
     # tar xpzf /whatever/you/put/NsCDE-<version>.tar.gz
     # cp -rp NsCDE-<version>/NsCDE /opt

     ... and optionally:

     # cd /usr/local/bin || cd /usr/bin
     ln -s /opt/NsCDE/bin/nscde

    That's it. NsCDE is installed.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

NsCDE Startup

    Session can be started from the $HOME/.xsession in last command line as
   exec nscde, or exec /opt/NsCDE/bin/nscde or ssh-agent nscde or with
   gpg-agent, lxsession or whatever.

    If supported by the X Display Manager which is in use, an xsession file
   /opt/NsCDE/share/doc/examples/xsession-integration/nscde.desktop can be
   put in /usr/share/xsessions (or in whatever place your system and your X
   Display Manager reads this files) and then selected from the manager's
   menu or similar selector. See the rest of the X Session Manager
   integration examples are in directory /opt/NsCDE/share/doc/examples/ for
   MATE, KDE, LXDE and similar DE integrations and play with this if you
   like.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial Configuration

    Upon the first (successful) start, ~/.NsCDE, that is $FVWM_USERDIR is
   created, and only icons subdirectory is created as nscde-fvwm-menu-desktop
   is run. User will be presented with a default system setup and with
   default color theme Broica in 8 colors, and f_FindTerm function will try
   hard to find some usable terminal application and run it with setup. If
   Gkrellm, pnmixer and/or stalonetray programs are installed, on the system
   and found, they will be run too.

    Initial setup is a simple script ($NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/nscde_setup) from
   the terminal which will run automatically and will set up the following:

     * X resources in ~/.NsCDE

     * Default background color (pre-FvwmBacker) from default theme

     * Default ~/.NsCDE/NsCDE.conf

     * New empty ~/.NsCDE/GeoDB.ini

     * ~/.icons/default/index.theme (default X cursor scheme)

     * ~/.gtkrc-2.0

     * ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini

     * ~/.themes/NsCDE

     * ~/.config/Trolltech.conf

     * ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf

     * ~/.stalonetrayrc

    Note that no file from the above list will be overwritten if it already
   exists in it's place. It will be skipped, but GTK and Qt theme integration
   files can be still written with [82]Color Style Manager. After nscde_setup
   script finishes setup, [83]Color Style Manager will be run and user asked
   to confirm default theme or change it. Do not avoid this step, since some
   program bits are not fully setup on bare defaults, (like a clock
   background) and must be generated in the ~/.NsCDE/icons/NsCDE directory.

    After [84]Color Style Manager's OK button is pressed, theme will be
   regenerated. Gtk and Qt themes will be regenerated only if their
   checkboxes in [85]Color Style Manager are checked in. Setup script after
   the finish will ask user to press RETURN to exit. This is for user's
   convenience to read output of the setup for informative and/or diagnostic
   reasons. It is advised after this setup to open $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf
   and set up InfoStoreAdd internal FVWM variables for terminal, filemgr and
   xeditor to user's favorite programs for functions.

    Layout of the $FVWM_USERDIR after the initial setup should look like
   this:

     * app-defaults/

     * backdrops/

     * palettes/

     * fontsets/

     * templates/

     * photos/

     * backer/

     * GeoDB.ini

     * icons/

     * icons/NsCDE/

     * NsCDE-Backdrops.conf

     * NsCDE-Colorset.conf

     * NsCDE.conf

     * tmp/

     * Xdefaults

     * Xdefaults.fontdefs

     * Xdefaults.local

     * Xdefaults.mouse

    It is advised to logout and login from the X session after this, and
   check if everything looks ok. Also, it is a good idea to start using
   programs from the menu and examine environment around for a half an hour
   or so, before running Style Manager (2nd button right of the Workspace
   Manager on the Front Panel) to customize other aspects of the interface.
   NsCDE is now ready for usage.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integration with X resources and widgets

  Integration of X resources

    NsCDE is using it's own copies of Xdefaults and includes files for X
   resources integration in $FVWM_USERDIR. X resources are filled with this
   from $NSCDE_ROOT/bin/nscde main wrapper during startup as the part of
   session assembling. Variable XAPPLRESDIR is also adjusted to
   $FVWM_USERDIR/app-defaults. There can be problems while using certain X
   session managers or DE which are clearing environment on a startup, and in
   this cases user must take care to put environment from nscde wrapper in
   place after startup. Probably autostart job in $HOME/.config/autostart and
   select from Session Manager's app will do the job.

    Special private paths for X resources are used in order not to mess with
   user's maybe existing resources and files. If wanted, custom app-defaults
   files can be places in $FVWM_USERDIR/app-defaults or even better,
   $FVWM_USERDIR/templates/app-defaults and reworked for [86]Color Style
   Manager integration, because if find in that directory, and with .tmpl
   extension, it will be processed in the same way as system files from
   $NSCDE_ROOT/share/templates/app-defaults/ and put in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/app-defaults.

    Plain custom X resources can be put in $FVWM_USERDIR/Xdefaults.local.
   This file will not be overwritten by Style Managers. X resources
   integration is turned on by default in [87]Color Style Manager.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Gtk2, Gtk3, Qt4 and Qt5

    $NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/themegen.py with $NSCDE_ROOT/lib/python and with
   $NSCDE_ROOT/share/templates/integration/gtk2_gtk3_qt are parts of the
   optional Gtk2, Gtk3, Qt4 and Qt5 integration suite. When run from the
   [88]Color Style Manager or manually with the
   $NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/themegen.py, with proper options, this will produce
   $HOME/.themes/NsCDE directory with either or both Gtk2 and Gtk3 themes.
   $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0 and $HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini will be edited to
   point to this directory with gtk-theme-name option. Excessive button
   images on menus and buttons will be turned off of course.

    If Qt4 and/or Qt5 integration is also selected in [89]Color Style
   Manager, files $HOME/.config/Trolltech.conf and
   $HOME/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf will be edited to use "GTK2" Qt theme
   engine. This means, there is no Qt4 and/or Qt5 integration without at
   least Gtk2 integration because Gtk2 theme in use is deciding what GTK2 Qt4
   and Qt5 engine will display. For Qt5 integration, make sure
   qt5-qtstyleplugins (or something like that name) is installed:
   platformthemes/libqgtk2.so is needed.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Custom application integration

    If $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local exists, [90]Color Style Manager
   will run it if it's checkbox is selected. This script or program will be
   run with a full path of CDE palette file followed by the number of colors
   selected in interface (4 or 8). This can be useful for regenerating
   settings of applications which do not use X resources, and neither GTK nor
   Qt, but have support for some level of customization of this resources.
   Also "skins" for programs like smplayer, audacious and Gkrellm can be
   processed from custom colormgr.local.

    In the directory $NSCDE_ROOT/share/doc/examples/Gkrellm is the complete
   NsCDE theme for the Gkrellm. File
   $NSCDE_ROOT/share/doc/examples/colormgr.local.example can be used for this
   integration. There are also examples for Stalonetray and mate-terminal.
   Local script colormgr.local will most likely use
   $NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/nscde_palette_colorgen.py in some way.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional recommended software

    Since NsCDE is basically a collection of configurations, themes and tools
   around FVWM and not desktop environment in official definition, user must
   choose some favorite and default applications such as X terminal emulator
   file manager, and X editor, which will then be provided to him in
   occations where programs of that type must be called.

    Apart from this, since system tray concept has been introduced on X11 and
   is here to stay, user will need some standalone tray application. For this
   purpose, a logical and really great stalonetray (Stand Alone Tray) is more
   than adequate. If NsCDE example configuration for stalonetray is used, it
   will have grid 3x3 and it's place will be in the bottom right corner of
   the screen. Stalonetray is not integrated into Front Panel because it's
   size cannot be known in all times: is it one button size, two, ten? It is
   growing and shrinking depending on number of widgets or tray icons, and
   apart from that, this can significantly alter the precious CDE look of the
   Front Panel. A window with traditional mwm/dtwm borders and without title
   in corner of the screen is default in NsCDE. Ideas are welcome.

    X Terminal program? Urxvt, xterm, mate-terminal, terminus ... user's
   choice as always. As a slight recommendation, mate-terminal from MATE DE
   can be set to look almost as Dtterm, but with richer menu and better UTF-8
   handling, the bad thing is that configuration if not done via GUI or
   configuration file but is stored in binary DCONF registry, and registry
   editor like dconf-editor or or dconf gsettings must be used for
   non-interactive or CLI editing. See the example in
   $NSCDE_ROOT/share/doc/examples/colormgr.local.example on how to integrate
   mate-terminal with a [91]Color Style Manager. Second (if not first) best
   choice is Urxvt, but since it does not have a menu nor a real tabs,
   tmux(1), screen(1) or possibly tabbed(1) can be used for the same
   functionality. Suggestions for more dtterm-like alternative are welcome.

    File manager? Since author does not use them very much, there is no some
   strong suggestion. Maybe Krusader from KDE is a best choice because it has
   a lot of features and functions plus two pane mode for work. It looks like
   a total contrast to GNOME way of doing things, so it must be good,
   although it is not at all similar to CDE's original dtfile(1), but
   dtfile(1) is a bad and poor file manager anyway. Another reasonable choice
   can be pcmanfm or pcmanfm-qt. For something more original, Xplore file
   manager is written with Motif widget. It looks nice, but it is unfinished
   (lacks real actions for many things, and instead input dialogs are popped
   up for copy/paste ...) it is not maintained and developed, and if someone
   does not brings it up from the past it can serve only for overview of
   directories, simple actions and nice Motif decoration.

    Editor? Gvim, Emacs, Xemacs, Nedit ... user's choice.

    Another nice and useful app is Gkrellm for which NsCDE has a ready
   drop-in theme called (of course) NsCDE in share/doc/examples and it can be
   put in user's ~/.gkrellm2/themes and integrated with [92]Color Style
   Manager with the $NSCDE_ROOT/share/doc/examples/colormgr.local.example
   which can be installed as $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local.

    X Compositor: if user likes visual effects with tinting, transparency,
   shadows, 3D, smooth changes and so on, compton(1) standalone compositor is
   an excellent program and tool for such users - who want to combine retro
   and modern style. Personally, I feel it like some kind of lag, no matter
   how powerful GPU, CPU and RAM I have. I turn it on occasionally, more as
   an amusement of xsnow, xsanta or xeyes type, but when I have serious work
   to do, I simply turn it off in some moment. Maybe it can be better if it
   is configured more conservative than example. See
   /opt/NsCDE/share/doc/examples/compton-integration for a starting point.

Similarities and differences in usage and look between CDE and NsCDE

    NsCDE is not a mere clone of CDE. Under the first visual impression,
   there are unintentional and intentional differences.

    First of all, it is not a standalone Window Manager or Desktop
   Environment written in some language(s). It is a patchwork which owns 80%
   of it's functionality to wonderful and powerful Window Manager of FVWM.
   Other parts are configurations, scripts and programs which are making the
   whole thing to function like the combination of the CDE experience and
   modern powerful X Window Manager. Here are some things that I can recall
   to be different - for the worse or for the better, user's opinion may
   vary.

    What is similar or the same:

     * There is a recognizable titlebar and buttons

     * Titlebar buttons have the same basic (left click) actions as CDE

     * Color themes and theming

     * Front Panel and subpanels

     * Workspace Manager

     * Workspace Menu / Root Menu (right click on the root window)

     * Workspaces (desks)

     * Most of the icons reused

     * Backdrops

     * Style Manager launcher and most of the Style Managers

     * Occupy Workspace dialog

     * Workstation Info window (as found in Solaris CDE)

     * FpLite (not with the same function)

     * Front Panel clock, calendar and check mail

     * Icon positioning

     * Look and feel via FVWM Styles

     * Nice vintage but somewhat irritating wait cursor in the sand clock
       shape

     * Various misc small imitations ...

    Differencies exist: for worse or better. They are described here in
   detail with complete explanations:

     *   Workspace Manager has a four fixed choices for workspaces (desks).
       As in CDE four is a default, but combinations with 2, 6 and 8 are
       possible. If reduced to 2 desks, WSM buttons will grow in width to
       fill fixed space of the WSM FvwmScript applet. If 6 or 8 desks are
       configured, buttons will shrink and will be narrower. For that reason,
       in 6 and 8 desks mode it is not possible to have page indicator
       (WSM.conf: WSPPG) on the right side of the desk buttons, but this
       doesn't exist in CDE anyway, since CDE doesn't have concept of pages
       (in my best knowledge). This means that Front Panel has always a fixed
       width which is ok for a distinctive look and for screens with smaller
       resolutions - it will not grow or shrink depending of number of desks
       and their buttons shown in WSM.

     *   No drag and drop. This is specially visible in Install Icon action
       which actually calls custom tool Subpanel Manager for this actions.
       Subpanel Manager itself will be rewritten in a nicer and less buggy
       way on the first good occasion.

     *   No Dt Actions builder, and never will be. Write FvwmScript scripts
       or use some toolkit in combination with python, perl ...

     *   No Application Manager. If integration with Install Icon and
       possibly menus will be possible with some file manager, it may be
       (re)invented in the future.

     *   Keybindings are 90% custom made, and user have a choice to use it or
       - partially or totally rewrite it. There are more functions and
       actions in NsCDE than in CDE, and hence there are a lot of key
       bindings.

     *   Mouse bindings - some actions like Workspace Menu in CDE are
       mimicked in NsCDE, titlebar and titlebar buttons too, but since there
       is no much of them in original CDE anyway, there is a plenty of custom
       mouse bindings and mouse bindings in combination with modifier keys.
       As for keybindings apply: use it or write your own.

     *   [93]Color Style Manager has numerous new functions: Gtk and Qt
       integration, X resources integration is optional, and it has even a
       possibility to run a custom script with required parameters of current
       palette and number of colors for external and marginal color scheme
       integrations - like Gkrellm for example. Palette color editor is
       missing. It should be possible to write it in the FvwmScript in some
       future version update.

     *   [94]Font Style Manager is totally NsCDE oriented and doesn't work
       much as font management in CDE. NsCDE supports XFT fonts (disable
       antialiasing if you want extreme original look) and it combines 5
       groups of fonts in 3 sizes described in this documentation.

     *   [95]Keyboard Style Manager implements all options supported by the
       xset(1) on PC. CDE original in default installation at least, seems to
       have only auto-repeat and click volume controls.

     *   [96]Mouse Style Manager does not have configurable middle mouse
       (button 2) action since this is not applicable very much on today's
       GUI widgets.

     *   [97]Beep Style Manager has a additional Beep button for testing
       during setup.

     *   Screensaver Style Manager is in fact Xscreensaver setup. Perfect
       drop in replacement and much fancier than original.

     *   [98]Window Style Manager manages much more of window, icon, pages
       and animation behavior than original program in CDE, and even this is
       a small subset of options in FVWM. See it's documentation and fvwm(1)
       man page.

     *   [99]Power Style Manager is actually very rare in Style Manager
       across old CDE setups. It manages DPMS setting of the monitor with
       xset(1).

     *   Startup Style Manager is available only if NsCDE is started under
       some X Session Manager. It detects supported DE's and starts
       appropriate settings tool for that desktop environment if it is found.

     *   Pages: not present in CDE in best of my knowledge. Only workspaces
       (desks) in original. Page Manager (PGM) is a custom widget which is
       using place left bottom of the Workspace Manager. It can change
       current page or invoke ("...") graphical pager - FvwmPager(1) for a
       current workspace (desk).

     *   Custom keyboard and mouse actions on titlebars, buttons and root
       window.

     *   WsPgMgr - Manage Workspaces and Pages. NsCDE invention.

     *   FpLite is measuring system load, not desktop activity. It has much
       more fine grained indication of activity with colors, and it's height
       is 3x of the original for a better visibility. On click it is calling
       FVWM function which will run terminal program with top or similar
       program, or anything else if use overrides that function in local
       configuration.

     *   Calendar and Mail widgets are placeholders and simple indicators
       which are expected to be extended with already named functions to do
       what user wants.

     *   Probably some more small differences.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patches for FVWM

    Optional but recommended patches for FVWM 2.6.7 and 2.6.8 are in
   /opt/NsCDE/src directory.

    This patches will add:

     *   Three underlines Menu Style (used in MenuFvwmRoot for NsCDE)

     *   corrections for cursor icon under buttons of the FvwmScript(1) it is
       really not a nice thing to have XC_hand2 which is usually used for
       hyperlinks as a pointer icon when mouse is above buttons. Planned to
       be implemented as an option, not to disturb old default, no matter how
       bad is probably that default

     *   FvwmButtons(1) WindowName support - an native alternative to
       xdotool(1) workaround. It will set name and icon name of single
       subpanels, that is, every FvwmButtons object which has titlebar
       enabled with FVWM styles

     *   FvwmButtons triangle-in (sunken) support. Provides a 3rd argument
       for indicator parameter of the FvwmButtons(1) button. It can be "in"
       (default for NsCDE in config/NsCDE-FrontPanel.conf) or "out" to
       confirm the FVWM default. If omitted, "out" is default, since it was
       that way before this patch.

    In order to have patched fvwm, apply this patch or patches against FVWM
   2.6.7 or 2.6.8 source and (re)compile FVWM. You can even make your own RPM
   DEB, Arch, BSD, SunOS or similar package from that and install it.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Credits

    Apart from FVWM, GTK integration framework was forked from one advanced
   theme, clock is old standalone widget which I have found in the old X11
   software archives while searching for something which can act as a Front
   Panel clock. Pclock fits here perfectly. Xscreensaver seems to me as a
   logical choice for screensaver facility.



     *   For forked CDEtheme: Jos van Riswick

     *   For pclock on a Front Panel: Alexander Kourakos

     *   For using Xscreensaver: Jamie Zawinski

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Missing parts and existing problems

     *  Application Manager: Maybe with the help of some extensible (but sane
       and standalone, with titlebar) file manager, but question remains how
       to send enumerated apps from such a file manager view to Front Panel
       subpanels or as submenu. Probably external drag and drop applet which
       can be swallowed in subpanels to accept drop with middle mouse move
       and edit subpanel configuration? This will than replace Subpanels
       Manager app, but it must also have functions for editing, deleting etc
       ...

     *  Action builder (dtaction) - not likely ever. Use FvwmScript or maybe
       some Python gui bindings.

     *  Session Management (dtsession) - NsCDE can use the external custom
       Session Managers from various DE's. See examples in
       share/doc/examples. Since there are similar programs in existence,
       plus FVWM's own functions for automatic start of programs, NsCDE is
       more or less covered here.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ideas and Tasks for future improvements

     *   Some default editor to be used as a Application Manager

     *   Rewrite a bad Subpanel Manager and awkward subpanel handling

     *   Geometry manager: introduce step that will ask for Window to be
       saved in GeoDB.ini with Name, Icon Name, Class or Resource in order to
       be more flexible with applications which have multiple windows with
       the same class name.

     *   Palette color editor in [100]Color Style Manager is missing. It
       should be possible to write it in the FvwmScript(1).

     *   Find or write the replacement for PyQt4/PyQt5 API in Gtk/Qt theme
       integration

     *   FvwmScript for setting default X terminal emulator, X editor, file
       manager?

     *   Modern (in a sense of specs and completness) icon theme with the
       rest of available CDE icons (as much as possible)? Easy, but a lot of
       long time boring work.

     *   Localization. It will be hard and a lot of work. Specially
       FvwmScript(1) elements which are dependent on text length.
       Localization for Script elements, menus and documentation is the
       scope.

     *   ...
