File nscde.desktop is a sessionless standalone launcher definition for display managers.
It is tested with lightdm, sddm and gdm. If you don't want a customized desktop session
with X Session manager, or cannot get it to work with mate-session, gnome-session or
startkde, this should really work for sure. Other options are maybe $HOME/.xsession or
$HOME/.xinitrc.
