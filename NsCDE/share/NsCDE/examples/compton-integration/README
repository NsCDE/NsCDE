Place compton.conf into $HOME/.config. You can start it (-b for daemon mode)
from the $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Init.conf or from session manager.

It is nice and eye candy, but when you forget about desk design and start doing
some real work, fast switching pages. Don't be suprised by yourself if you call
pkill compton in some moment.

It is maybe best to start it on demand. Or configure it even more conservative,
because everything feely laggy with this delayed animations and shadows.

IMPORTANT:
For some reason FvwmScript based NsCDE tools with PopupMenu widget are not
refreshed properly when this (or compton-ng) X compositor are active, thus
newly selected value from the popup list is not displayed on screen.
To work around this bug, uncomment "SetEnv NSCDE_REDRAW_WORKAROUND 1" in
your local ~/.NsCDE/NsCDE.conf and restart NsCDE (or logout and login).
