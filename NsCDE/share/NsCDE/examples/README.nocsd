Working around "CSD"

This README describes how to configure GNOME applications which are crippled with
so called "Client Side Decorations" or CSD and are insisting to send request to
window manager to be started without title bars, corners and borders. Such
applications are similar to unmanaged windows started on a bare X server without
window manager: they cannot be moved and resized in a easy way. Moreover, they
look poor any ugly. In their war against title bars, and generally against users,
GNOME didn't provided option which can be set to disable this rogue behaviour.

If there is really a need to use some of this applications, solution exists here
luckily - from the author of the excellent file manager PCManFM:

See https://github.com/PCMan/gtk3-nocsd

From gtk3-nocsd web page:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gtk3-nocsd is a small module used to disable the client side decoration of Gtk+ 3.

Introduction: Since Gtk+ 3.10, its developers added a so-called header bar or custom
title bar. With this and the client-side decoration, the original title bar and
window border provided by the window manager are disabled by Gtk+. This makes all
Gtk+ 3 programs look alike. Even worse, this may break some window manager or compositors.

Unfortunately, the Gtk+ developers decided to be against the existing standards and
provide "no option" to turn it off.

Luckily, with gtk3-nocsd, we still have a way to (partially) turn it off. Window manager
(title bar and window border) can be re-enabled.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this preload hack library, GTK3 can be tricked to provide "legacy", that is
to bring applications in (more or less) sane mode.

Some additional hacks:

1. Save this as $HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css
-------------------------------------------------
headerbar {
   border-radius: 0;
}

headerbar .title {
   color: transparent;
   font-size: 0pt;
}
-------------------------------------------------
This should ensure that size of this (in)famous CSD header bar is a bit thinner and
that title (which belongs to the title bar) is not duplicated below into "headerbar"
which looks somewhat as menubar, but without most of it's functionality.


2. If you cannot use gtk3-nocsd for whatever reason, FVWM can provide at least
partial solution: it can ignore application request for special managing and put
title bar (with borders and corners) on such applications anyway. Here is the
example for most if not all GNOME applications on the default Fedora 31 workstation
installation. This can be pasted into $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Style.local. Notice:
there is no need for this step if gtk3-nocsd is installed and if it works.
