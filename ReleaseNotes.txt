NsCDE 1.0rc24 (pre)release notes

Two and half months after 1.0rc22 prerelease, new release candidate again has
extended functionality of the NsCDE. There will be no more new functionalities
before 1.1 release, just couple of months for fixing and polishing existing
code. NsCDE 1.1 (1.0 was actually long ago), will be released probably in
december, on the day when all started 2 years ago.

Here are the highlights of what has changed and what is added between 1.0rc22
and 1.0rc24

1. New Apps and Features

- NProcMgr: NsCDE Process Manager: application which shows NsCDE FVWM and
  other processes, their pids and running/presence state. Processes can be
  started, stopped and restarted. It also has capabilities for rereading
  various parts of the configuration: Menus, Functions, Style, Keybindings
  etc. NsCDE Process Manager is present by default on the Desktop Settings
  submenu (7) of the Front Panel, but it can also be found on the Workspace
  Menu NsCDE submenu, as well as from Watch Errors and Fvwm Console contextual
  part of the Window Options Menu.

- GeometryMgr: Before 1.0rc22, "Save Geometry" option on the Window Options
  Menu or Meta+F6 directly called function which saved current window
  geometry, so windows will be positioned and sized on exact geometry
  coordinates next time when they appear on the page and workspace for the
  first time, or with "Reposition Window" option of the Window Options Menu.
  Needles to say, this option was easy to catch with mouse by mistake, and
  even more with key binding.
  New FvwmScript application brings dialog with window class and resource
  names, and exact coordinates when Save Geometry is called, plus info about
  previous remembered pixel size and position if any. Here, user can inspect,
  tune, cancel or confirm that new saving. Clearing all values and choosing
  save clears that and any before existing geometry mapping for that screen
  resolution.

- Custom Front Panel Launchers: from the beginning until now, Front Panel
  had fixed number of launchers (big icon or applet plus optional submenu)
  on the left and right side of the Workspace Manager. Now, with a usage of
  Front Panel Controls menu and it's "Number of Launchers ..." submenu, user
  can reduce to 0, or extend to 20 number of launchers. As in CDE, default
  is 10 launchers (5 left, and 5 right), which gives 10. This can be doubled
  or reduced to 4, 3, 2, 1 or no launchers at all. This allows user to make
  configurations with Workspace Manager leftmost or rightmost on the Front
  Panel, to make minimal only Workspace Manager plus handlers Front Panel
  without launchers, or to make really wide Front Panels with 18, 19 and
  with maximum 20 launchers (screen resolution must support such stretching
  of the Front Panel). All new custom launchers can be customized to contain
  icons or applets, to have or not subpanels.

- Wide or Eco Workspace Manager: together with custom launchers on the Front
  Panel, Workspace Manager (WSM) now by default has fixed width of workspace
  buttons. This means that shrinking workspace to 2 workspaces will shrink
  Front Panel, and expanding workspaces to 6 or 8 will expand it. This is
  in contrast to fixed WSM on which until now the buttons themselves where
  shrinked (6, 8) or expanded (2), but WSM frame remained of the same width.
  New behaviour is in sync with visual CDE behaviour and gives a chance for
  wider workspace names in 6  or 8 workspaces mode. Old fixed width WSM can
  be used if InfoStore variable wsm.eco is defined and set to 1 in
  $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf

- Splash screen: NsCDE has now splash screen on startup. It displays logo,
  information about system on which it is running, NsCDE and FVWM version,
  licence and such. It lasts some 6 seconds on start, but can be speed up
  with Control+C or by clicking on the text.

- Show Workspace functionality: called by the Root Menu as "Clean/Restore
  Workspace", by Ctrl + Left click on the root window and with Meta+Alt+W
  keybinding. It will iconify all windows on the page or restore them on
  subsequent calls. Already iconified windows prior to calling this function,
  as well as newly opened windows on the page will not be affected by this
  group iconify / deiconify (show desktop) action. During this action, any
  animation which may be configured with Window Style Manager for FvwmAnimate
  will be temporary disabled to avoid long dance on the screen if there are
  many windows on it.

- New keybindings:
  - Meta+Shift+Tab will cycle workspaces backwards.
  - Meta+Alt+W calls Show Desktop

- Dunst support: A nice FVWM-friendly notification daemon dunst(1) is probably
  the best choice for custom DE environments and classis Window Managers. It
  is now tightly integrated with NsCDE in the same was as stalonetray: it can
  be enabled or disabled with InfoStore variable nscde_use_dunst 0/1 in user's
  $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf. Configuration is provided and partially managed
  (Color Style Manager and Font Style Manager) by the NsCDE as
  $FVWM_USERDIR/Dunst.conf

- New Palettes and Backdrops:
  - palettes: LateSummer
  - backdrops: CubesSmall and Pearls

- Merge of the VUE Palettes and Backdrops: there is no need to install this as
  addon. It is merged with other palettes and backdrops, because it is fully
  compatible, no matter that this comes from pre-CDE era.

- New finder for Audio Volume Control application: gives it's best to find
  working audio mixer app on the subpanel of launcher 9 on the Front Panel.

- Installer.ksh: support staged installation (for packaging) with -D
