                Not so Common Desktop Environment (NsCDE) Manual

Installation Dependencies

    For NsCDE to work, essential software is FVWM Window Manager. Almost all
   is based on it. Since NsCDE is heavy user of infostore internal variables
   and other new features of FVWM, development has been done on FVWM versions
   2.6.7 and 2.6.8. At this time, this are recommended, if not mandatory
   versions of FVWM for NsCDE. Other dependencies, that is, software used by
   NsCDE is:

     *  Korn Shell 93. All shell script routines inside configuration, helper
       scripts and FvwmScript helpers are written with ksh. It is not sure if
       pdksh can be drop in replacement, but in tests on Arch Linux with mksh
       it became clear that mksh cannot replace Korn Shell. Korn Shell is
       available and it is free.

     *  Xorg utils (Fedora/CentOS RPM xorg-x11-utils) - xdpyinfo, xprop ...

     *  Util xdotool - only if FVWM is not patched with WindowName patch for
       the FvwmButtons

     *  ImageMagick - really needed.

     *  Xscreensaver - optional, but Screen Style Manager will not work
       without it. Something needs to be installed for locking the screen.

     *  cpp - C preprocessor for xrdb functionality - for X resources
       integration. Used by xrdb(1).

     *  xorg-x11-server-utils (CentOS, Fedora name) - xrdb, xset, xrefresh
       mandatory for startup, some style managers and menus.

     *  python-yaml - needed for python part of the color theme management
       and for Gtk+Qt integration.

     *  PyQt4 or possibly python-qt4, or python2-qt4. This is unfortunate
       dependency which is further dependent on Qt libraries. NsCDE tries to
       have as less as possible dependencies, specially indirect
       (dependencies of dependent dependencies of dependencies ...). Gtk/Qt
       integration is borrowed from CDEtheme Motif/CDE theme project and
       adapted for use with FVWM (instead of heavy Xfce dependency) or
       standalone engine. In part of the Theme.py code, some png pixmaps are
       cut and colored with functions from this API. With present job and
       lack of time, there was no time to do this without PyQt4 for the first
       public release.

         On CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu and probably Debian, also on FreeBSD,
       there should be no problem to install this with package manager, but
       in tests on Arch Linux, PyQt4 was obsoleted and user will have a hard
       time getting source from AUR and compiling huge bunch of Qt4
       libraries. There is possibility to replace PyQt4 with PyQt5 imports in
       code and it will work, no matter that it will segfault and core dump
       on the exit.

     *  Gtk2, Gtk3, Qt4, Qt5, qtconfig-qt4, qt5ct, qt5-qtstyleplugins
       (optional) There is a great chance this libraries and some usefull
       programs using them are already installed on user's system. If Gtk and
       Qt integration is activated in [70]Color Style Manager, there is no
       point not to have it installed.

         Notice about Qt4 and Qt5: qt4-config (or qt-config) and qt5ct:
       Although colors will be applied, for font setting to take effect,
       qtconfig-qt4 (or qtconfig) must be run, something changed back and
       forth, and then applied/saved - no matter that you will see fonts of
       your choice already selected. This can be considered a bug. Same goes
       for Qt5.

         Notice about Qt5: QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME environment variable must be
       set, and be set to qt5ct value in order to run qt5ct configurator.

     *  Recommended fonts for as close as possible CDE look are DejaVu Serif
       for variable, and DejaVu Sans Mono for monospaced fonts. Check should
       be made if this fonts are installed on the system. For Solaris CDE
       look, Lucida Sans and monospaced Lucida Sans Typewriter should be
       installed, selected and used instead. (optional)

     *  Open Motif 2 libraries for some programs, although it is not used in
       any part of the NsCDE. (optional)

     *  Stalonetray for "tray" facility (optional)

     *  xterm

     *  python3 (FVWM)

     *  python34-pyxdg or python3-pyxdg or ... (FVWM)

     *  libstroke (FVWM)

     *  perl-File-MimeInfo (on some platforms and some fvwm packages)

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation

    When FVWM and all/most above mentioned dependencies are met, NsCDE can be
   used. Present installation is very simple:

     $ su - || sudo -i
     # umask 0022
     # cd /tmp
     # tar xpzf /whatever/you/put/NsCDE-<version>.tar.gz
     # cp -rp NsCDE-<version>/NsCDE /opt

     ... and optionally:

     # cd /usr/local/bin || cd /usr/bin
     ln -s /opt/NsCDE/bin/nscde

    That's it. NsCDE is installed.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

NsCDE Startup

    Session can be started from the $HOME/.xsession in last command line as
   exec nscde, or exec /opt/NsCDE/bin/nscde or ssh-agent nscde or with
   gpg-agent, lxsession or whatever.

    If supported by the X Display Manager which is in use, an xsession file
   /opt/NsCDE/share/doc/examples/xsession-integration/nscde.desktop can be
   put in /usr/share/xsessions (or in whatever place your system and your X
   Display Manager reads this files) and then selected from the manager's
   menu or similar selector. See the rest of the X Session Manager
   integration examples are in directory /opt/NsCDE/share/doc/examples/ for
   MATE, KDE, LXDE and similar DE integrations and play with this if you
   like.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial Configuration

    Upon the first (successful) start, ~/.NsCDE, that is $FVWM_USERDIR is
   created, and only icons subdirectory is created as nscde-fvwm-menu-desktop
   is run. User will be presented with a default system setup and with
   default color theme Broica in 8 colors, and f_FindTerm function will try
   hard to find some usable terminal application and run it with setup. If
   Gkrellm, pnmixer and/or stalonetray programs are installed, on the system
   and found, they will be run too.

    Initial setup is a simple script ($NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/nscde_setup) from
   the terminal which will run automatically and will set up the following:

     * X resources in ~/.NsCDE

     * Default background color (pre-FvwmBacker) from default theme

     * Default ~/.NsCDE/NsCDE.conf

     * New empty ~/.NsCDE/GeoDB.ini

     * ~/.icons/default/index.theme (default X cursor scheme)

     * ~/.gtkrc-2.0

     * ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini

     * ~/.themes/NsCDE

     * ~/.config/Trolltech.conf

     * ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf

     * ~/.stalonetrayrc

    Note that no file from the above list will be overwritten if it already
   exists in it's place. It will be skipped, but GTK and Qt theme integration
   files can be still written with [71]Color Style Manager. After nscde_setup
   script finishes setup, [72]Color Style Manager will be run and user asked
   to confirm default theme or change it. Do not avoid this step, since some
   program bits are not fully setup on bare defaults, (like a clock
   background) and must be generated in the ~/.NsCDE/icons/NsCDE directory.

    After [73]Color Style Manager's OK button is pressed, theme will be
   regenerated. Gtk and Qt themes will be regenerated only if their
   checkboxes in [74]Color Style Manager are checked in. Setup script after
   the finish will ask user to press RETURN to exit. This is for user's
   convenience to read output of the setup for informative and/or diagnostic
   reasons. It is advised after this setup to open $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf
   and set up InfoStoreAdd internal FVWM variables for terminal, filemgr and
   xeditor to user's favorite programs for functions.

    Layout of the $FVWM_USERDIR after the initial setup should look like
   this:

     * app-defaults/

     * backdrops/

     * palettes/

     * fontsets/

     * templates/

     * photos/

     * backer/

     * GeoDB.ini

     * icons/

     * icons/NsCDE/

     * NsCDE-Backdrops.conf

     * NsCDE-Colorset.conf

     * NsCDE.conf

     * tmp/

     * Xdefaults

     * Xdefaults.fontdefs

     * Xdefaults.local

     * Xdefaults.mouse

    It is advised to logout and login from the X session after this, and
   check if everything looks ok. Also, it is a good idea to start using
   programs from the menu and examine environment around for a half an hour
   or so, before running Style Manager (2nd button right of the Workspace
   Manager on the Front Panel) to customize other aspects of the interface.
   NsCDE is now ready for usage.
