+               Not so Common Desktop Environment (NsCDE) Manual

Installation Dependencies

    For NsCDE to work, essential software is FVWM Window Manager. Almost all
   is based on it. Since NsCDE is heavy user of infostore internal variables
   and other new features of FVWM, development has been done on FVWM versions
   2.6.7 and 2.6.8. At this time, this are recommended, if not mandatory
   versions of FVWM for NsCDE. Other dependencies, that is, software used by
   NsCDE is:

     *  AT&T original Korn Shell 93. All shell script routines inside
       configuration, helper scripts and FvwmScript helpers are written in
       Korn Shell (ksh). Clones such as pdksh, mksh and some other variants
       found by default on some *BSD core systems canot be drop in replacement.
       Korn Shell is available and it is free. Use you systems' package manager
       to install it, or fetch it from here: https://github.com/att/ast

     *  Xorg utils (Fedora/CentOS RPM xorg-x11-utils) - xdpyinfo, xprop ...

     *  Util xdotool - only if FVWM is not patched with WindowName patch for
       the FvwmButtons

     *  ImageMagick - really needed.

     *  Xscreensaver - optional, but Screen Style Manager will not work
       without it. Something needs to be installed for locking the screen.

     *  cpp - C preprocessor for xrdb functionality - for X resources
       integration. Used by xrdb(1).

     *  xorg-x11-server-utils (CentOS, Fedora name) - xrdb, xset, xrefresh
       mandatory for startup, some style managers and menus.

     *  python-yaml - needed for python part of the color theme management
       and for Gtk+Qt integration.

     *  PyQt4, PyQt5 or possibly python3-qt4, python-qt5 or python3-qt5 or ...
       This is unfortunate dependency which is further dependent on Qt
       libraries. NsCDE tries to have as less as possible dependencies,
       specially indirect (dependencies of dependent dependencies of
       dependencies ...). Gtk/Qt integration is borrowed from CDEtheme
       Motif/CDE theme project and adapted for use with FVWM (instead of
       heavy Xfce dependency) or standalone engine. In part of the Theme.py
       code, some png pixmaps are cut and colored with functions from this
       API. With present job and lack of time, there was no time to do this
       without PyQt5 or PyQt4 for the first public release.

     *  Gtk2, Gtk3, Qt4, Qt5, qtconfig-qt4, qt5ct, qt5-qtstyleplugins
       (optional) There is a great chance this libraries and some usefull
       programs using them are already installed on user's system. If Gtk and
       Qt integration is activated in [70]Color Style Manager, there is no
       point not to have it installed.

         Notice about Qt4 and Qt5: qt4-config (or qt-config) and qt5ct:
       Although colors will be applied, for font setting to take effect,
       qtconfig-qt4 (or qtconfig) must be run, something changed back and
       forth, and then applied/saved - no matter that you will see fonts of
       your choice already selected. This can be considered a bug. Same goes
       for Qt5.

         Notice about Qt5: QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME environment variable must be
       set, and be set to qt5ct value in order to run qt5ct configurator.

     *  Recommended fonts for as close as possible CDE look are DejaVu Serif
       for variable, and DejaVu Sans Mono for monospaced fonts. Check should
       be made if this fonts are installed on the system. For Solaris CDE
       look, Lucida Sans and monospaced Lucida Sans Typewriter should be
       installed, selected and used instead. (optional)

     *  Open Motif 2 libraries for some programs, although it is not used in
       any part of the NsCDE. (optional)

     *  Stalonetray for "tray" facility (optional)

     *  XSETTINGS xsettingsd daemon for theme and X settings dynamic
        management (optional)

     *  xterm

     *  python3 (FVWM)

     *  python34-pyxdg or python3-pyxdg or python36-pyxdg or ... (FVWM)

     *  libstroke (FVWM)

     *  perl-File-MimeInfo (on some platforms and some fvwm packages)

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation

    When FVWM and all/most above mentioned dependencies are met, NsCDE can be
   used. Present installation is very simple:

     $ su - (or sudo -i)
     # umask 0022
     # cd /tmp
     # wget https://github.com/NsCDE/NsCDE/archive/<version>.tar.gz
     # tar xpzf <version>.tar.gz
     # cd NsCDE-<version>
     # ./Installer.ksh -w -i (or ./Installer.ksh -f -i)

     ... and optionally:

     # cd /usr/local/bin (or cd /usr/bin)
     ln -s /opt/NsCDE/bin/nscde

    That's it. NsCDE is installed. You may need to resrart your X Display
    Manager (such as lightdm, gdm, sddm ...) for NsCDE entry to appear as
    login option.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

NsCDE Startup

    If not invoked from X Display Manager, NsCDE X session can be started
   from the $HOME/.xsession in last command line as "exec nscde", or as
   "exec /opt/NsCDE/bin/nscde" (or "ssh-agent nscde" or with gpg-agent,
   lxsession or whatever).

    If supported by the X Display Manager which is in use, an xsession file
   /opt/NsCDE/share/doc/examples/xsession-integration/nscde.desktop when
   put in /usr/share/xsessions by the installer or manually (or in whatever
   place your system and your X Display Manager reads this files) and then
   selected from the manager's menu or similar selector.
   See the rest of the X Session Manager integration examples are in directory
   /opt/NsCDE/share/doc/examples/ for MATE, KDE, LXDE and similar DE
   integrations and play with this if you like.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial Configuration

    Upon the first (successful) start, ~/.NsCDE, that is $FVWM_USERDIR is
   created, and only icons subdirectory is created as nscde-fvwm-menu-desktop
   is run. User will be presented with a default system setup and with
   default color theme Broica in 8 colors, and f_FindTerm function will try
   hard to find some usable terminal application and run it with setup. If
   Gkrellm, pnmixer and/or stalonetray programs are installed, on the system
   and found, they will be run too.

    Initial setup is a simple script ($NSCDE_ROOT/libexec/nscde_setup) from
   the terminal which will run automatically and will set up the following:

     * X resources in ~/.NsCDE

     * Default background color (pre-FvwmBacker) from default theme

     * Default ~/.NsCDE/NsCDE.conf

     * New ~/.NsCDE/GeoDB.ini with some sane defaults

     * ~/.icons/default/index.theme (default X cursor scheme)

     * ~/.gtkrc-2.0

     * ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini

     * ~/.themes/NsCDE

     * ~/.config/Trolltech.conf

     * ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf

     * ~/.stalonetrayrc

    Note that no file from the above list will be overwritten if it already
   exists in it's place. It will be skipped, but GTK and Qt theme integration
   files can be still written with [71]Color Style Manager. After nscde_setup
   script finishes setup, [72]Color Style Manager will be run and user asked
   to confirm default theme or change it. Do not avoid this step, since some
   program bits are not fully setup on bare defaults, (like a clock
   background) and must be generated in the ~/.NsCDE/icons/NsCDE directory.

    After [73]Color Style Manager's OK button is pressed, theme will be
   regenerated. Gtk and Qt themes will be regenerated only if their
   checkboxes in [74]Color Style Manager are checked in. Setup script after
   the finish will ask user to press RETURN to exit. This is for user's
   convenience to read output of the setup for informative and/or diagnostic
   reasons. It is advised after this setup to open $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf
   and set up InfoStoreAdd internal FVWM variables for terminal, filemgr and
   xeditor to user's favorite programs for functions.

    Layout of the $FVWM_USERDIR after the initial setup should look like
   this:

     * app-defaults/

     * backdrops/

     * palettes/

     * fontsets/

     * config_templates/

     * photos/

     * backer/

     * GeoDB.ini

     * icons/

     * icons/NsCDE/

     * NsCDE-Backdrops.conf

     * NsCDE-Colorset.conf

     * NsCDE.conf

     * tmp/

     * Xdefaults

     * Xdefaults.fontdefs

     * Xdefaults.local

     * Xdefaults.mouse

    It is advised to logout and login from the X session after this, and
   check if everything looks ok. Also, it is a good idea to start using
   programs from the menu and examine environment around for a half an hour
   or so, before running Style Manager (2nd button right of the Workspace
   Manager on the Front Panel) to customize other aspects of the interface.
   NsCDE is now ready for usage.
