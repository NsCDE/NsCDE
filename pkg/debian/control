Description: Not so Common Desktop Environment
 NsCDE is a retro but powerful UNIX desktop environment which resembles
 CDE look (and partially feel) but with a more powerful and flexible
 framework beneath-the-surface, more suited for 21st century unix-like
 and Linux systems and user requirements than original CDE.
 .
 NsCDE can be considered as a heavyweight FVWM theme on steroids, but
 combined with a couple other free software components and custom FVWM
 applications and a lot of configuration, NsCDE can be considered a
 lightweight hybrid desktop environment.
