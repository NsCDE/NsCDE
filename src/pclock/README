pclock v0.13.1
--------------

pclock is a simple analog clock program designed primarily to run under the
Window Maker window manager. Any 64x64 pixmap may be used as a background,
including tiles. Contributions of interesting backgrounds are welcome.

One current limitation is that the clock hands are drawn within the mask of
the background XPM file.

To build:
  edit src/Makefile
  make

Use ``pclock --help'' for instructions.

This program has only been tested with Linux and Window Maker, on a
high-color display. It should work on 8-bit displays if you use backgrounds
with small numbers of colors!

Note: you might find it useful to run multiple clocks in different
timezones, this can be accomplished by using the following command for each
clock:

  env TZ=<timezone> pclock

Just replace <timezone> with the name of a timezone (on my computer, they
are in /usr/share/zoneinfo, one example is ``US/Pacific''). Watch out
though, Window Maker doesn't remember the command correctly so you may need
to edit your config files by hand to add back the ``env TZ=..'' part.
