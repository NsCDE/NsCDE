NsCDE is basically a collection of configurations, themes and tools around FVWM
and is a kind od "hybrid" desktop environment as unofficial definition and attempt
to define it, user must choose some favorite and default applications such as
X terminal emulator file manager, and X editor, which will then be provided to
him in occations where programs of that type must be called.
</p><p>
Apart from this, since <span class="emphasis"><em>system</em></span> tray concept has been introduced on X11 and is
here to stay, user will need some standalone tray application. For this purpose, a logical and
really great <span class="command"><strong>stalonetray</strong></span> (Stand Alone Tray) is more than adequate. When NsCDE
configuration for stalonetray <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/Stalonetray.conf</code> is used, it
will have this defaults: grid 3x3 and it's place will be in the bottom right corner of the
screen. Stalonetray is not integrated into Front Panel because it's size cannot be known in all
times: is it one button size, two, ten? It is growing and shrinking depending on number of widgets
or tray icons, and apart from that, this can significantly alter the precious CDE look of the
Front Panel. A window with traditional mwm/dtwm borders and without title in corner of the screen is
default in NsCDE. Alternative ideas are welcome.
</p><p>
There are some programs which needs to be run under escalated privileges. Usually as root.
Some examples are firewall-applet(1) for managing firewalld on Linux systems, Wireshark etc ...
For this purpose on Linux (and most probably BSD systems), so called <span class="emphasis"><em>PolicyKit</em></span>
or "polkitd" is used as a authenticator component, while on the client side, PolicyKit agent
must be used. This will then prompt user for a password. Since there is no equivalent of
this agent as standalone DE-indepentent program analogously to stalonetray(1) or dunst(1),
probably the closest match and most often used is polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1 which is
usually installed in <code class="filename">/usr/libexec</code> and relatively without
huge dependencies on some desktop environment. It can be started from profile, for example from
InitFunction in <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/Init.fvwmconf</code> or by using dex autostarter
from this very file (default Init.fvwmconf has an example for this).
</p><p>
Small python program <span class="emphasis"><em>dex(1)</em></span> can be installed and used from InitFunction
in <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/Init.fvwmconf</code>. This program can be configured to read
system autostart files in <code class="filename">/etc/xdg/autostart</code> and/or
user's from <code class="filename">$HOME/.config/autostart</code>. From here,
PolicyKit agent, NetworkManager applet, Nextcloud agent, Firewall agent, pnmixer and similar
can be started. Programs such as stalonetray(1), dunst(1), xsettingsd(1), xscreensaver(1)
are not candidates for this, since they are integrated directly with NsCDE and managed
by it's configuration and autodetenction procedures.
</p><p>
If found, and if configured in <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf</code> with InfoStore
variable <code class="varname">nscde_use_dunst</code> set to 1, NsCDE will make fresh copy of
<code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/Dunst.conf</code> if it doesn't already exist, and start
<span class="emphasis"><em>dunst(1)</em></span> notification daemon. This standalone notification daemon is
highly configurable and is Window Manager and Desktop Environment agnostic. Usage of
dunst(1) is highly recommended.
</p><p>
If found, and if configured in <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf</code> with InfoStore
variable <code class="varname">nscde_use_picom</code> set to 1, NsCDE will make fresh copy of
<code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/Picom.conf</code> if it doesn't already exist, and start
<span class="emphasis"><em>picom(1)</em></span> X compositor. Picom is very configurable, and user can
customize this file as per wishes and needs. Usage of picom(1) is not necessary, but
it may fix some tearing issues or make many openings and moves on the desktop look more
smooth. On the other hand, it may introduce bugs in rare cases, as invisible popdown menus
poor screen refresh and some background artefacts. Bug conditions are depending on X
server version, actual video driver, picom's own configuration and mix of this circumstances.
</p><p>
X Terminal program? <span class="command"><strong>Urxvt</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong> xterm</strong></span>,
<span class="command"><strong>mate-terminal</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong> terminus</strong></span> ... user's choice
as always. As a slight recommendation, <span class="command"><strong>mate-terminal</strong></span> from MATE DE can be
set to look almost as Dtterm, but with richer menu and better UTF-8
handling, the bad thing is that configuration if not done via GUI or configuration file but is
stored in binary DCONF registry, and registry editor like <span class="command"><strong>dconf-editor</strong></span> or
or dconf <span class="command"><strong>gsettings</strong></span> must be used for non-interactive or CLI editing.
Second (if not first) best choice is <span class="command"><strong>Urxvt</strong></span>, but since it does not have a menu nor a
real tabs, tmux(1), screen(1) or possibly tabbed(1) can be used for the same functionality.
Suggestions for more dtterm-like alternative are welcome.
</p><p>
File manager? Since author does not use them very much, there is no some strong suggestion.
Maybe <span class="command"><strong>Krusader</strong></span> from KDE is a best choice because it has a lot of features
and functions plus two pane mode for work. It looks like a total contrast to GNOME way of
doing things, so it must be good, although it is not at all similar to CDE's original
dtfile(1), but dtfile(1) is a bad and poor file manager anyway. Another reasonable
choice can be <span class="command"><strong>pcmanfm</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>pcmanfm-qt</strong></span>. For something
more <span class="emphasis"><em>original</em></span>, Xplore file manager is written with Motif widget.
It looks nice, but it is unfinished (lacks real actions for many things, and instead input
dialogs are popped up for copy/paste ...) it is not maintained and developed, and if someone
does not brings it up from the past it can serve only for overview of directories, simple
actions and nice Motif decoration. Defined as <code class="varname">$[infostore.filemgr]</code> in NsCDE.
</p><p>
Editor? Gvim, Emacs, Xemacs, Nedit ... user's choice. Defined as
<code class="varname">$[infostore.xeditor]</code> in NsCDE.
</p><p>
Another nice and useful app is <span class="command"><strong>Gkrellm</strong></span> for which
NsCDE has a ready drop-in theme called (of course) NsCDE in
<code class="filename">share/config_templates</code> and it can be put in user's
<code class="filename">~/.gkrellm2/themes</code> and integrated with
<a class="link" href="NsCDE-ColorMgr.html" title="5.5. Color Style Manager">Color Style Manager</a> with the
<code class="filename">$NSCDE_DATADIR/config_templates/colormgr.addons</code> which is by default
called from user's <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local</code>, or the
whole code definition is in user's colormgr.local if NsCDE has been installed prior to
version 2.1.
</p><p>
If standalone freedesktop autostarter <span class="command"><strong>dex</strong></span> (sometimes called "dex-autostart")
is installed, it will be used by default <code class="filename">Init.fvwmconf</code> function
<code class="function">CommonInitFunction</code> in local mode: it will read and start ".desktop" files
in the <code class="filename">$HOME/.config/autostart</code> directory.
</p><p>
X Compositor: if user likes visual effects with tinting, transparency,
shadows, 3D, smooth changes and so on, <span class="emphasis"><em>compton(1)</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>compton-ng(1)</em></span>
or <span class="emphasis"><em>picom(1)</em></span> standalone compositors are excellent programs and tools for such users,
who want to combine retro and modern style. In the time of writing this, it looks like <span class="emphasis"><em>picom(1)</em></span> is
the most maintained of this three X compositors. Personally, I feel it like some kind of <span class="emphasis"><em>lag</em></span>, no matter how
powerful GPU, CPU and RAM I have. I turn it on occasionally, more as an amusement of xsnow, xsanta or xeyes type,
but when I have serious work to do, I simply turn it off in some moment. Maybe it can be better if it is
configured more conservative than example. See
<code class="filename">/opt/NsCDE/share/examples/compton-integration</code> for a starting point.
Syntax of this file is largely compatible for all three above mentioned X compositors.
</p><p>
Notice: when X Compositor is active on X display, FVWM geometry indicator which is shown
at the center of the screen during window move or resize actions will not be visible. Also,
consider uncommenting <code class="varname">NSCDE_REDRAW_WORKAROUND</code> and set it to 1 in your
<code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDe.conf</code>.
