NsCDE subpanels are simple transient FvwmButtons based docks. As the Front Panel itself,
they are also as much as possible similar to original CDE forms of the same purpose.
Some applications in them are predefined, and discovered if installed, and the rest is
up to user to populate. Their purpose is not to show all possible GUI applications
installed on the system as right-clicked Workspace Menu does. They are meant for
favorite, important and often used programs.
</p><p>
There is one big difference between CDE and NsCDE subpanels: <span class="emphasis"><em>Install Icon</em></span>
is not (and cannot be due to FvwmButtons not implementing) drag-and-drop destionation. Click
action on <span class="emphasis"><em>Install Icon</em></span> calls special NsCDE tool for installing and
defining items on the subpanel. There is no drag and drop off items from the applicaton manager
(the later also doesn't exist, but it can be used as menu://applications/ pseudo path in some
file managers).
</p><p>
On every subpanel, last selected entry will remain hilighted next time subpanel is popped up again.
</p><p>
Each Subpanel's application item or entry has additional third mouse pointer button action which
will pop up dinamically populated contextual menu named after item's title. Here, the following
actions are available:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Application Entry Name (varies): clicking it will have the same effect as first mouse button click
This is a kind of a escape from the contextual menu, but to still use subpanel's default action
without repeating opening of a submenu again.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Move Up: move the current item one space up
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Move Down: move the current item one space down
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Move to Beginning: move the current item to top of the subpanel
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Move to End: move the current item to bottom of the subpanel
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Copy to Main Panel: Promote item icon to the main panel as bigger icon, keeping it's function
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Rename: Rename the current item on the subpanel
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Delete: Delete the current item from the subpanel (warning message will appear before
deletion is finally performed)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Help: Display relevant documentation
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If move or delete action is silently not performed, this is most likely the situation where
user's <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/Subpanels.actions</code> is newer than
<code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/Subpanels.fvwmX.fvwmconf</code>, and must be rebuilt for
configuration actions to take a place properly. In that case, repeated operation must succeed,
otherwise, see X session error log for details.
</p><p>
Subpanels, like in CDE has titlebars but as windows on screen they are without
borders and handles. They have only left menu button like other windows, but
with one exception: there are no actions for closing window and re-positioning
it (no sense in this), but they have "Refresh Subpanel" and "Subpanel
Settings" controls. First one kills process module, re-reads it's
configuration and starts it on the next click on Front Panel subpanel
launcher. Subpanel Settings is the small and simple FvwmScript tool which
allows one to rename Subpanel, set it's width for application titles to fit if
necessary, and to enable or disable that particular Subpanel.
</p><p>
On the first change with <span class="emphasis"><em>Install Icon</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Subpanel Settings</em></span>,
non-FVWM configuration file <span class="emphasis"><em>Subpanels.actions</em></span> will be created in the
<code class="varname">$FVWM_USERDIR</code>, from there, all subpanels changed from default will be read
by the <span class="command"><strong>$NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/generate_subpanels</strong></span>, while the rest will be
generated and combined/mixed from the <code class="filename">$NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/Subpanels.actions</code>.
This file can also be edited by hand (ok, not by hand, but editor will suffice) and the result may be applied by
calling <span class="command"><strong>generate_subpanels</strong></span> and then <code class="function">f_ReadCfg Subpanels</code>.
Generated files will be called <code class="filename">Subpanels.fvwm2.fvwmconf</code> and <code class="filename">Subpanels.fvwm3.fvwmconf</code>
with the same content, but a slightly different syntax, one of this files will be read as subpanels configuration
depending under which version of FVWM NsCDE is running. This files are expected to appear in the <code class="varname">$FVWM_USERDIR</code>.
If not found there, <code class="filename">$NSCDE_ROOT/config/Subpanels.fvwmX.fvwmconf</code> will be read instead.
Syntax of the Subpanels.actions is explained in the <a class="link" href="NsCDE-Configuration-Files.html" title="8. Configuration files explained">Configuration files explained</a>
section.
</p><p>
Presently, there is one workaround here under FVWM2: as much as FVWM, and specially FvwmButtons are
very flexible and configurable, no title for the buttons app can be set apart from module alias, but
module alias doesn't support names with spaces in them. Internal names as <span class="emphasis"><em>"NsCDE-SubpanelX"</em></span>
are for that reason referenced in <code class="filename">FrontPanel.fvwmX.fvwmconf</code>, and are internally
mandatory names of their Subpanels. Because there is no configuration option in FVWM2 for subpanel
to set Window Title, we are using tool <span class="command"><strong>xdotool(1)</strong></span> which is run on Subpanel
initialization with a delay of 3,2 seconds (internal workaround for xdotool) and this then takes
infostore variable <code class="varname">NsCDE-SubpanelX-Name</code> and sets literal, system default or user
picked name of the subpanel. Presently, an alternative option is to apply FvwmButtons patch present
in the patches subdirectory of NsCDE tarball which introduces a <span class="emphasis"><em>WindowName</em></span> option
for FVWM2 to it's configuration, or even better, to use new FVWM3 which has this and many other handy
options and capabilities already in place.

The rest about Subpanel, or to say their visible outfit, and their main function
are the same as in CDE - a nice, heavyweight and elegant application launchers.
