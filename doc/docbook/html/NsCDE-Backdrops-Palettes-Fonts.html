Together with Workspace Manager, Backdrops and Palettes are probably most
recognizable aspects of CDE, by which CDE is visually distinguished from
other desktop environments.
</p><p>
CDE backdrops, are relatively simple XPM textures and pictures consisting
usualy from 2-5 <span class="emphasis"><em>base</em></span> colors: <span class="emphasis"><em>background</em></span>,
<span class="emphasis"><em>foreground</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>selectColor</em></span>,
<span class="emphasis"><em>topShadowColor</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>bottomShadowColor</em></span>.
This colors are taken from the current (or custom) palette and applied to the symbolic
definition of colors in XPM templates. Backdrop is then generated, tiled and
applied to the root window. Every workspace can have it's own backdrop texture. In
4 colors mode of the palette theme, they are all colored in the same pattern,
while in 8 colors mode, every workspace from 1-4 has it's own color variant from
the current palette, in that case, workspaces from 5 to 8 are repeating colors
from 1 to 4. In other words, if there are more that four desks defined, color of
the fifth workspace is repeated color of the first, sixth of the second and so on.
</p><p>
Here, in addition to original CDE textures, there are some 100 new and custom
textures created from (free and public) textures which were convenient for
this customization. In other words, NsCDE implements more than 100 backdrops,
and with Backdrop Style Manager user can import to it's
<code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/backdrops</code> it's own backdrops,
or put them there with terminal or file manager.
</p><p>
Backdrops must have alternative extension for X Pixmaps: that is, not
<span class="emphasis"><em>.xpm</em></span>, but <span class="emphasis"><em>.pm</em></span>.
</p><p>
If one wants their custom backdrop to be dynamic with palette/theme of NsCDE,
one must edit them to set symbolic names of the colors described above. Examining
existing backdrops is the fastest way to get idea what needs to be done. Apart
from symbolic names, backdrops also have a real color defined to be compatible
with XPM specification, but values of this colors can be arbitrary, since they
are not used if symbolic name on the same line is set. Usually, they are in gray
spectrum.
</p><p>
Default backdrops are set from the
<code class="filename">$NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/backer</code> until
user does not redefine/set his own with
<a class="link" href="NsCDE-BackdropMgr.html" title="4.2. Backdrop Style Manager">Backdrop Style Manager</a>. Default
palette is <span class="emphasis"><em>Broica</em></span> in 8 colors variant.
</p><p>
Thematically generated backdrops generated by <a class="link" href="NsCDE-BackdropMgr.html" title="4.2. Backdrop Style Manager">Backdrop Style manager</a>
are installed in user's <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/backer/DeskN-&lt;backdropname&gt;.pm</code> and defined
in <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/Backdrops.fvwmgen</code> as colorsets of
<span class="emphasis"><em>TiledPixmap</em></span> type. NsCDE reserved FVWM colorsets numbers for backdrops
are from 31-38 for all eight possible workspaces.
<code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/Backdrops.fvwmgen</code> file is read by FvwmBacker(1) FVWM module.
It is automatically generated when user makes first change with
<a class="link" href="NsCDE-BackdropMgr.html" title="4.2. Backdrop Style Manager">Backdrop Style Manager</a>.
</p><p>
Until then, system wide file <code class="filename">$NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Backdrops.fvwmconf</code>
applies, which itself reads pre-generated and pre-defined backdrops from the
<code class="filename">$NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/backer</code> directory.
Default color theme is <span class="emphasis"><em>Broica</em></span>.
</p><p>
We can consider backdrops as the source form or template files, and when processed
with color values from the palette, this backdrop's final form is, ready to be set by FvwmBacker(1).
</p><p>
When NsCDE is used with FVWM3 and <span class="emphasis"><em>per-monitor</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>shared</em></span>
DekstopConfiguration monitor modes, FvwmBacker(1) is not in use, because it cannot treat different
physical (and virtual) monitors separately. Functions driven by the <span class="emphasis"><em>new_desk</em></span>
FvwmEvent(1) event are called in that case, which will be loaded from the cache directory
<code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/backer/bgcache</code> if found, or automatically
generated with the help of ImageMagick's convert(1) tool if they do not exist, and then loaded.
This mechanism automatically calculates screen width, height, X and Y coordinates, desks and backdrops
to produce cjoined backdrops as one big PNG file which is then loaded to show correct background
for desks on different monitors.
