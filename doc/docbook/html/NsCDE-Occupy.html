This tool dialog is called from the left titlebar button 1 Window Operations Menu as
"Occupy Workspace", "Occupy Page" or "Occupy Monitor". Or from <span class="keysym">Meta+Space</span> key for Workspace,
<span class="keysym">Alt+Space</span> for Page, and <span class="keysym">Meta+Alt+Space</span> key combinations from the window context. Occupy tool is
the extended (for FVWM pages and multiple monitors) version of the same CDE dialog and it sends selected window to a
workspace, page or XRandR monitor selected from the list, or it can make it sticky across workspaces and/or
pages with <span class="guibutton">All Workspaces</span> or <span class="guibutton">All Pages</span> checkbox
pressed in. One addition here is the checkbox <span class="guibutton">Go With the Window</span>; when checked,
makes NsCDE to change a current workspace, page and/or monitor and go with the window, or where window was sent.
Radio buttons <span class="guibutton">Workspaces:</span>, <span class="guibutton">Pages:</span> and <span class="guibutton">Monitors:</span> are changing the
current context of operation between workspaces, pages and monitors, which is visually also manifested in the
main list as the names of either workspaces, pages or RandR names of the monitors. If called as "Occupy Workspace",
pages or monitors can also be selected and changed by switching this context with this buttons or with the <span class="keysym">Space</span>
key shortcut in focused Occupy window. Radio button for monitors and "Occupy Monitor" functionality is only shown
and available if multiple physical (or virtual) monitors are detected by FVWM and NsCDE.
<span class="guibutton">OK</span> performs an action, <span class="guibutton">Dismiss</span> quits Occupy tool without
taking action.

On the upper left part of the window there are three buttons with labels <span class="guilabel">Workspaces</span>,
<span class="guilabel">Pages</span> and <span class="guibutton">Monitors:</span>. When either one or another selection is changed from the current state,
that is, state of the workspace and page on which window context was when Occupy is called, there will
appear an ASCII asterisk (*) symbol at the end of the label. This means selection is changed, and this
is visible for workspaces or monitors even when pages are on the selection list and/or vice versa. If selection is
changed back again to state of page, workspace and/or monitor, which was initial, asterisk will disappear, but will
again appear when this selection is changed to some other choice again. That way, orientation of what
was touched can be known.
