Workspace Manager is a Widget in the center of the Front Panel. Visually, it
replicates in almost a pixel similarity with the center of the CDE's Workspace
Manager's buttons, but with a few exceptions beneath the surface and further
configuration:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
 There is a limited number for possible of workspaces. There can be no odd number of
  workspaces, and combinations are: 2, 4, 6 and 8. Default is of course 4.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 If InfoStore variable wsm.eco is defined as <span class="emphasis"><em>"InfoStoreAdd wsm.eco 1"</em></span> in
 user's profile <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf</code>, WSM buttons will not be fixed
 in width as in CDE. In that case, Workspace Manager will not extend a width of the Front Panel,
 rather buttons will be more wide in 2-buttons combination, and more narrow in 6 and specially 8
 button combination. By default, buttons are all of the same width and they are extending or
 narrowing the cummulative Front Panel width size if changed from default 4 workspaces
 to 2, 6 or 8 workspaces.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 As in CDE, workspace names can be renamed. There is a keyboard combination in FvwmScript WSM
 which enters rename mode: Ctrl+Space on the current active workspace button, while pointer is
 above it. Then, <span class="keysym">Ctrl+Enter</span> saves a new name. Names are synchronized with FVWM
 desktop names and used in the rest of the configuration. Names are saved in
 <code class="filename">$FVWM_USERDIR/WSM.conf</code>, and EWMH desktop names are applied immediately in
 a existing X11 NsCDE session. Workspaces can also enter rename mode if their workspace buttons
 are clicked with 3rd mouse button and <span class="guimenuitem">Rename ...</span> option choosen from
 the popup menu.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
If Sun type keyboard is in use, <span class="keysym">Help</span> key above
WSM will bring this help text in browser. On PC keyboard, <span class="keysym">F1</span> has the
same function.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Addition: right mouse button on workspace button brings contextual menu. From
  this menu, the following items can be selected: default acion (activate workspace),
  <span class="guimenuitem">Rename ...</span> to rename the workspace, <span class="guimenuitem">Manage ...</span>
  to call Workspace and Page Style Manager,Popup menu <span class="guimenuitem">Go to Page ...</span>,
  <span class="guimenuitem">Local Pager</span> (visual FvwmPager) (for a workspace, not necessarily the current one),
  then the option <span class="guimenuitem">Windows ...</span> to bring up Window List, with windows on that
  workspace, and last, a small submenu <span class="guimenuitem">Go to Page ...</span> for changing the active
  page on the that workspace, which will of course change active workspace to that where page was selected.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Number of Workspaces and Pages can be configured with Workspace and Pages Style Manager tool.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
State of the buttons is synchronized by FVWM function called from FvwmEvent(1) module whenever
desks and pages are changed by other means, such as keyboard shortcut, mouse move, or by issuing
direct commands to <span class="command"><strong>FvwmCommand(1)</strong></span>.
</p><p>
In 4-color palette mode, all WSM buttons are of the same color, while in 8-colors mode, there
are four color variations from the given palette.
</p><p>
Workspaces in NsCDE are named and numbered from 1, while in FVWM (where they are called desks),
they start from 0. This fact required additional effort while coding FvwmScripts and making
core configurations.
