   This manual describes NsCDE: Not so Common Desktop Environment.
   Visual CDE clone built with more up to date tools, to fit with
   modern day toolkits and applications. NsCDE is invented to
   provide "blast from the past" which is perfectly usable for
   professionals and people tring to recover from PTSD syndrome
   after beeing in touch with so called "material design" and
   various toy-like interfaces.

1. Introduction

1.1. What is NsCDE?

   In a nutshell, NsCDE is CDE visual clone built with more moden
   tools around FVWM window manager. Tehnically, it can also be
   considered a heavyweight FVWM theme enriched with additional
   free software tools and applications, combining all this
   components into something which can be called lightweight
   hybrid desktop environment. It can even be integrated into
   existing desktop environments with session management as a
   window manager wrapper for session handling and additional DE
   functionality.

   NsCDE's main goal is to revive somewhat brutalist look and feel
   of the Common Desktop Environment found on many UNIX and
   unix-like systems during nineties and first decade of the 21
   century, but with a more polished interface (XFT, unicode,
   dynamic changes, rich key and mouse bindings, workspace pages,
   rich menus etc) and a goal to produce comfortable "retro"
   environment which is not just a eye candy toy, but a real
   working environment for users who contrary to mainstream trends
   really like CDE, thus making semi-optimal blend of usability
   and compatibility with modern tools with look and feel which
   mainstream abadoned for some new fashion, and ... in a
   nutshell, giving to user the best of the both worlds.

   Main driver behind NsCDE is the excellent FVWM window manager
   with it's endless options for customization, GUI Script engine,
   Colorsets, and modules. NsCDE is largely a wrapper around FVWM
   - something like a heavyweight theme, sort of. The other
   important pars are FvwmScript GUI in which CDE-like tools are
   written, GTK2 and GTK3 theme for unifying look and feel, which
   can also extend to Qt4 and Qt5 with gtk engine of Qt, X
   settings which are following the same theme rules, icon theme,
   python programs, converters and generators, korn shell scripts,
   CDE-compatible backdrops and palettes and misc pieces for
   integration like CSS theme for Firefox and Thunderbird, and
   stand alone integrated desktop-making parts like stalonetray,
   dunst, xsettingsd, xscreensaver etc. Since NsCDE 2.1 for Qt5
   there is a experimental Kvantum SVG based NsCDE engine as an
   alternative for Qt5 gtk2 engine.

1.2. Why NsCDE?

   Since the 90-ties, I have always liked this environment and
   it's somewhat crude socrealistic look, described by some people
   as brutalism in achitecture. All that in a contrast to "modern"
   Windows and GNOME flat black/white interfaces and Google's
   "material" design - which are going in the opposite taste
   direction from what I always liked to see on my screen. I have
   created this environment for my own usage 8-10 years ago and it
   was a patchwork, chaotic and not well suited for sharing with
   someone. While it looked ok on the surface, behind it was a
   years of ad hoc hacks and senseless configurations and scripts,
   dysfunctional menus etc. Couple of months in a row I had a time
   and chance to rewrite this as a more consistent environment,
   first for myself, and during this process, idea came to do it
   even better, and put on the web for everyone else who may like
   this idea of CDE for 21st century. Year by year NsCDE has 3
   years now. Many things are added, changed, hardened, debugged.

   NsCDE is intended for a people which doesn't like "modern"
   hypes, interfaces that try to mimic Mac and Windows and
   reimplementing their (poor) ideas for non-technical user's
   desktops, and reimplementing them even more poorly. Older and
   mature system administrators, programmers and generally people
   from the Unix background are more likely to have attraction to
   NsCDE. It is probably not well suited for beginners.

   Of course, question arises: why not simply use original
   original CDE now when it is open sourced?

   Apart from desirable look, because it has it's own problems: it
   is a product from 90-ties, based on Motif and time has passed
   since then. In CDE there is no really smooth out of the box XFT
   font rendering, no immediate application dynamic changes, there
   are insecure RPC and obsolete tooltalk procedures even for
   starting local applications. Beside that, I have found dtwm,
   CDE's window manager inferior to FVWM and some 3rd party
   solutions which can be paired with it. So I wanted the best of
   the two worlds: good old retro look and feel from original CDE,
   but more flexible, modern and maintained "drivers" behind it,
   which will allow for individual customizations as one find's
   them fit for it's own amusement and usage. As it will be seen
   later, there are some small intentional differences between CDE
   and NsCDE - a middle line between trying to stay as close as
   possible to look of the CDE, but with more flexibility and
   functionality on the second and third look.

1.3. Path conventions

   In this document, a certain file and directory components of
   the NsCDE are referred with variables. This variables
   represents system or user paths. The former can be different on
   different systems, depending the OS convention for instaling
   third party software, or if NsCDE was installed from the
   package or the source tarball. For example, on BSD systems,
   ports and packages will usually use /usr/local as the
   installation base (reffered by NsCDE as $NSCDE_ROOT), while on
   Linux, this is often /usr if installed from the package. On
   Solaris systems, this can be /usr/sfw, while on NetBSD it may
   default to /usr/pkg. Various components of this installarion
   base, such as share, lib or similar are represented with the
   following variables:

     * $NSCDE_ROOT - the base of the installation, such are
       /usr/local or /usr
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR - refers to share/NsCDE directory. Probably
       majority of the stuff is located here. FVWM configurations,
       defaults, program bits, backdrops, photos, palettes, config
       templates, non-XDG old style icons, integration templates
       etc ...
     * $NSCDE_LIBDIR - refers to lib/NsCDE directory. This can
       often be lib64/NsCDE or lib/<arch>-linux-gnu/NsCDE
       directory. Here are FvwmScript, Python and C components, as
       well as wrappers which may override some FVWM modules.
     * $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR - refers to libexec/NsCDE directory. but it
       is often the same as $NSCDE_LIBDIR specially on Debian and
       it's clones. Here are the python programs and scripts, as
       well as shell helpers used by FVWM functions and FvwmScript
       programs. Altrough not intended to be run manually, it can
       be used by advanced users to achieve some integration or
       additional locale functionality. For example, python
       command palette_colorgen is used in the default
       $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local to shape Gkrellm,
       Firefox, Thunderbird and such programs into the CDE palette
       color scheme. This is never installed in $prefix/bin paths,
       because it is not of general usage, and therefore to
       minimize commands in path pollution.
     * $FVWM_USERDIR refers to $HOME/.NsCDE. In an early phase of
       NsCDE startup, this is defined, so NsCDE never clashes with
       the default FVWM $HOME/.fvwm. User configurations,
       customizations and preferences are located there.

   Outside of this paths, NsCDE installs the following contents on
   the filesystem:

     * /etc/xdg/menus/nscde-applications.menu where /etc can be
       /usr/local/etc or some other install base.
     * $NSCDE_ROOT/share/xsessions/nscde.desktop: many X Display
       Managers pick up this. Exact installation depends on the
       system's defaults for xsession .desktop files.
     * share/icons/NsCDE - XDG compatible icon theme.
     * share/desktop-directories/nscde-* - XDG grouping of
       applications for NsCDE as dekstop environment.
     * share/doc/nscde - documentation (like this one)
     * share/locale/$LANG/LC_MESSAGES/... - ".mo" localization
       files.
     * bin/nscde - main starting wrapper.
     * bin/nscde_fvwmclnt - selector of the right FvwmCommand on
       the systems with multiple versions and paths of the FVWM
       installations.

2. Components of the NsCDE

2.1. Components overview

   NsCDE uses very extensive bunch of configurations, scripts and
   apps around FVWM. FVWM is in my opinion very good model of free
   choice for people who like to have things set up by their own
   wishes and who are aware what real freedom of choice is. A
   stunning contrast to policies forced on Linux an Unix users in
   the last decade from the mainstream desktop players.

   NsCDE is not using FVWM default $HOME/.fvwm if exists, but sets
   $FVWM_USERDIR to $HOME/.NsCDE, and uses $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm and
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/default as a sources of configuration.

   NsCDE configuration consists largely of files parsed by it's
   own scripts, and FVWM configuration which is grouped in
   separate thematic files. System FVWM configuration is
   initialized by nscde X startup wrapper which calls
   Main.fvwmconf. This file, as well as the rest of FVWM functions
   and code (except FvwmScript GUI programs) is located in
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm.

   FVWM configuration sections are:

     * Animate.fvwmconf - FvwmAnimate module configuration
     * Backdrops.fvwmconf - Backdrops, read by FvwmBacker and
       FvwmPager
     * Backer.fvwmconf - FvwmBacker module configuration
     * Colorset.fvwmconf - FVWM Colorset definitions (generated
       for user in ~/.NsCDE)
     * Event.fvwmconf - FvwmEvent module configuration
     * FinishInit.fvwmconf - End of startap cleanup and safety
       last-second routines
     * Font-XXXdpi.fvwmconf - Set of fonts ad InfoStore variables
       used across FVWM
     * Form.fvwmconf - obsolete and not used by default, NsCDE
       does not use FvwmForm
     * FrontPanel.fvwmconf - selector of FrontPanel configuration
       which is going to be read
     * FrontPanel.fvwm2.fvwmconf - FrontPanel configuration for
       FVWM2
     * FrontPanel.fvwm3.fvwmconf - FrontPanel configuration for
       FVWM3
     * Functions.fvwmconf - almost all functions used by NsCDE
       FVWM setup, paired in logical sections
     * IconMan.fvwmconf - Not used by default
     * Ident.fvwmconf - FvwmIdent module configuration
     * Init.fvwmconf - Fallback and example of session statup.
       Usually run from ~/.NsCDE
     * Keybindings.fvwmconf - Static key bindings, without written
       menu hints
     * LocalPager.fvwmconf - Single Workspace floating FvwmPager
       configuration
     * Main.fvwmconf - Most important and early FVWM directives,
       environment and InfoStore variables, functions
     * Menus.fvwmconf - All FVWM Menus used or generated for NsCDE
     * Monitors.fvwmconf - Monitor and resolution static database
       as helper for some calculations
     * Mousebindings.fvwmconf - All mouse actions with and without
       keyboard modifiers
     * Sandbox.fvwmconf - not read by default, cleanup definitions
       for stripped down NsCDE sandbox mode
     * Script.fvwmconf - FvwmScript module defaults
     * Style.fvwmconf - All NsCDE FVWM Style directives,
       Menustyle, Cursorstyle, Decor addons etc
     * Subpanels.fvwmconf - Default system configuration for
       subpanels of the FrontPanel, generated.
     * WspLocPager.fvwmconf - Configuration of another local pager
       which uses FvwmPager, but for non-local workspaces
     * NsCDE.conf - de-facto main user configuration file. All
       important variables are here.

   It should be noted that FVWM configuration system is created in
   a very flexible manner. While there are only files of type
   "fvwmconf" in $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm, user's $FVWM_USERDIR or
   "~/.NsCDE" can contain this 3 types of FVWM configuration:

     * Files with extension ".fvwmconf" are overriding defaults
       from the $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm. In other words, if
       $NSCDE_USERDIR/Init.fvwmconf exists, it will be read
       instead of $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Init.fvwmconf. For some
       parts of the FVWM configuration this makes a sense, for
       most it doesn't.
     * Files with extension ".fvwmgen" are files which are
       generated by NsCDE tools and GUI programs. They can be
       managed by hand, but usage of tools will overwrite them.
       They counterparts in the $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm have extension
       ".fvwmconf", but if for example
       $NSCDE_USERDIR/Colorset.fvwmgen exits, it will be read
       instead of $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Colorset.fvwmconf. Putting
       static $NSCDE_USERDIR/Colorset.fvwmconf will be unusual,
       and will disable GUI tools and FVWM under NsCDE to read
       dynamically generated configurations.
     * Third form of FVWM configuration in $NSCDE_USERDIR are
       ".fvwmlocal" files. This files will extend (append)
       configuration read from their ".fvwmconf" and/or ".fvwmgen"
       files. Good examples whould be Functions.fvwmlocal and
       Styles.fvwmlocal in $NSCDE_USERDIR to add local custom
       functions and per-application styles.

   One notable exception to this system of configuration is the
   way FVWM Styles are read. In addition to reading
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Style.fvwmlocal "early" configuration in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Style.override will be read from
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Style.fvwmconf just after applying general
   core style for all applications (*) but before reading custom
   application styles and prior to reading
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Style.fvwmlocal. This mechanism is intended for
   changing and overriding core style options which are not
   customizable by the Window Style Manager. Putting core Style
   options after NsCDE applications in the
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Style.fvwmconf are processed can nullify
   overrides for that particular applications, this is why this
   mechanism is provided. This file is not created in
   $FVWM_USERDIR by setup procedure or Style Managers, but it will
   be read if created manually.

   In addition to FVWM configuration read by fvwm window manager
   and it's modules, there are some files parsed by NsCDE scripts
   and programs in $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults.

   This files are:

     * AppMenus.conf - default per application addons for Window
       Operations menu on the 1st titlebar button
     * FrontPanel.actions - read by FVWM functions called when
       FrontPanel controls and buttons are used
     * Keymenu-<kbd_bind_set>.actions - Part of the FVWM NsCDE
       keybindings which have menu hints written on menus
     * Subpanels.actions - From this file, Subpanels.fvwmconf is
       generated.
     * WSM.conf - Workspace Manager and Graphical Workspace
       Manager configuration file

   All files above except WSM.conf if found in $NSCDE_USERDIR are
   read in addition to system defaults in $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults.
   Local lines and statemets in user's copy are overriding system
   defaults. WSM.conf is read exclusively from $NSCDE_USERDIR.
   System file is only an example.

   The rest of configuration is in $NSCDE_USERDIR. For example
   Dunst.conf, Stylonetray.conf, Xsettingsd.conf, NsCDE.radi
   (rofi), Xset.conf and Xdefaults. This files are either read by
   their programs which are called and configured/integrated by
   NsCDE, or by X server (Xset.conf, Xdefaults*). Various
   subdirectories contains additional data generated for the user
   or configured by the user. This parts of the configuration are
   described in more detail later in this document.

3. NsCDE Basics

   Default NsCDE hybrid desktop envoronment contains a Front Panel
   at the center bottom of the current workspace. The Front Panel
   displays most important application icons and applets,
   information about workstation, date, time, current active
   workspace and page, system load, and exit controls. The Front
   Panel and enables user to run applications, to log out, and to
   switch between workspaces and pages. Applications that are
   running are visible as X11 windows and icons on the workspace,
   bordered by FVWM window manager with title bar, buttons on the
   title bar, borders and corners. Applications can also be
   started from the Workspace Menu, which is displayed by clicking
   mouse button 3 on an unused part of the workspace backdrop
   (root window).
     __________________________________________________________

3.1. Desktop Overview

   Figure 1. Default NsCDE Desktop

   [fig_nscde.png]

   NsCDE as desktop provides windows, workspaces, keybindings,
   controls, menus and the Front Panel.

     * Windows contain software applications and are framed with
       controls so you can move them, resize them, or place them
       in additional workspaces.
     * Keybindings, or keyboard shortuts enables you to call
       actions or manipulate windows without touching the mouse
       and immediately.
     * Workspaces are the screen areas where application windows
       are placed when opened. We can consider workspaces as
       software or virtual screens.
     * Controls enable you to manipulate objects, select choices,
       or type information.
     * Menus provide access to commands used to manage windows and
       operate applications.
     * The Front Panel is a collection of frequently used
       controls, available in every workspace.

   Some of the windows, icons and objects you'll encounter as you
   use the desktop are:

     * Window icons
     * The Front Panel
     * Style Manager
     * File Manager
     * Editor
     * Tray
     __________________________________________________________

3.1.1. Window Icons

   When you a window is iconified, it becomes an icon on the
   workspace. To iconify a window, click the first of two buttons
   near the upper right corner of the window titlebar.

   To deiconify the window, double-click mouse button 1 on the
   icon. You can also deiconify the window by clicking its icon to
   display the Window menu and then clicking on the menu's
   Deiconify item.

   Figure 2. Window Icons on Workspace and Icon Menu

   [fig_icons.png]
     __________________________________________________________

3.1.2. Front Panel

   The Front Panel is a special window at the bottom of the
   display. It provides controls, indicators, and subpanels for
   quick overview and launch. The Front Panel also provides the
   workspace manager (WSM) for selecting a workspace. The clock,
   calendar, check mail, and FP Lite are examples of indicators.
   Arrow buttons over Front Panel controls are Subpanels
   launchers. Clicking an arrow button will open a Subpanel.

   Figure 3. Front Panel

   [fig_fp.png]
     __________________________________________________________

3.1.3. Style Manager

   Use Style Manager to easily customize many elements of the
   desktop including:

     * Colors, Backdrops
     * Font size
     * Keyboard, Mouse, Screensaver, Beep
     * Screen Power, Window Behavior, Workspaces and Pages
       Behavior

   To start Style Manager, click its icon on the Front Panel.
   Second right of the Workspace Manager.

   [fig_stylemgr.png]
     __________________________________________________________

3.1.4. File Manager and Editor

   [fig_filemgr_editor.png]

   File Manager and Editor are the user's choice among great
   amount of them for X11 interface. While it is totally possible
   to run NsCDE without them, many people prefer to have them.
   Good choices for graphical File Manager are Krusader, PcmanFM,
   PcmanFM-qt, Spacefm and so on. PcmanFM and PcmanFM-qt can serve
   also as application managers, because they support
   menu://applications/ pseudo-path which presents system catalog
   of installed GUI apps with their icons under their categories.
   Gvim is a good choice for editor, while some more lightweight
   include Mousepad, Nedit, Xfe ...
     __________________________________________________________

3.1.5. System Tray

   [fig_stalonetray.png]

   System Tray functionality is provided by the stalonetray(1)
   application which is fully integrated with NsCDE and serves
   well for the purpose of hosting tray icons added by the user,
   user's XDG autostart files by dex(1), or by the programs. By
   default, stalonetray is located in lower right corner of the
   screen, and it is configured in $FVWM_USERDIR/Stalonetray.conf.
     __________________________________________________________

3.2. Working with Window controls

   This section describes how to start applications in NsCDE, move
   them around, iconify, shade, resize, maximize, close and so on.
     __________________________________________________________

3.2.1. Window Frame Controls

   A window's frame provides controls with which you can:

     * Focus attention on a window, making it active for input
       from mouse or keyboard. When window is selected and it
       becomes active, its titlebar changes color into a active
       window color.
     * Move a window.
     * Turn the window into a icon (iconify).
     * Size a window.
     * Close a window, removing it from the desktop.
     * Migrate open window into other workspaces.

   Figure 5. Window Frame Controls: Titlebar and Buttons

   [fig_titlebar_buttons.png]

   The leftmost button on the window titlebar is menu button.
   Click the Window menu button to display the Window Operations
   Menu.

   To close a window and remove it from the desktop, double-click
   the Window menu button or display the Window menu and click on
   Close. If this doesn't work for some reason, you can try to
   forcibly remove a window with Forcefully Close.

   Right of the window title, there are iconify and maximize
   buttons. Iconify is the first one, while maximize is the
   rightmost at the corner. Click the iconify button to turn the
   window into a window icon. To restore a window from its icon,
   double-click the icon.

   Click the maximize button to display the window in maximized
   state. To ignore area of the Front Panel, and really maximize a
   window to the whole screen, double-click the button. Window can
   be turned into its former size by clicking the maximize button
   again.

   The title bar shows the name of the application that owns the
   window. Select a window by clicking its title bar. You can move
   a window by dragging its title bar. Clicking title bar with the
   third mouse button will lower or raise it below or above
   another overlapping window, second (middle) mouse button gives
   you a quick diagnostic and screenshot options menu.

   Click and drag a window's resize corner or border to resize the
   window in any direction.
     __________________________________________________________

3.2.2. Opening Application Windows

   There are couple ways to open applications in NsCDE. NsCDE
   offers a handy way to group often used applications and other
   applications in a more or less accessible desktop controls.

     * Front Panel: big icons of the Front Panel offer easiest and
       most visible access to applications. By default,it contains
       access to editor, office application, terminal, Style
       Manager, Printer Manager etc. This list can be customized
       to suit individual needs.
     * Subpanels of the Front Panel are by category grouped popup
       menus of applications. Often used, important and popular
       applications are here, and can be put here by the user, to
       suit the needs.
     * Workspace Menu: called with third mouse button on the root
       window (screen backdrop). It contains submenu Applications
       which is generated by gathering system GUI applications
       into categorized submenus. Almost every application is
       accessible from this menu. There is also a Quick Menu
       submenu of the Workspace Menu, where user can put it' picks
       of applications for ease of access.
     * Exec dialog, called with Alt+F12, or rofi(1) launcher if it
       is installed and configured to work with NsCDE. Here, the
       name of the command which invokes application can be typed.
       Return will execute a command and window will appear.
     * By using some file manager which supports
       menu://applications/ pseudo path, that is, it can serve as
       Application Manager. PcmanFM is a good choice here.
     * By typing application invocation commands into terminal
       emulator.
     __________________________________________________________

3.3. Using Workspaces

   Workspaces are like separate screens or windows. To help
   organize the desktop, user can have separate workspaces for
   different groups of related tasks. For example, a workspace
   named Reports could contain the tools you use to prepare
   reports, such as a spreadsheet, Libreoffice text, and graphics
   applications. You might set up other workspaces according to
   your projects. By default, NsCDE offers four workspaces named
   "One", "Two", "Three" and "Four".

   Figure 6. Front Panel Workspace Manager

   [fig_wsm.png]

   This section describes how to display workspaces, place windows
   in specific workspaces, and rename workspaces.
     __________________________________________________________

3.3.1. To Display Another Workspace

   Front Panel.
     __________________________________________________________

3.3.1.2. Keyboard

   Press Ctrl+Backspace twice: first time to focus Front Panel,
   then second time to get mouse pointer into the middle of
   Workspace Manager. Press the TAB key to move between WSM
   buttons. When pointer is above workspace you want to display.
   Press Return.
     __________________________________________________________

3.3.2. Relocating a Window into Other Workspaces

3.3.2.1. Mouse

   Click the titlebar menu button to display Window Operations
   menu. Choose Occupy Workspace from the menu. In the Workspaces
   list of the "Occupy Workspace" dialog select the workspace in
   which you want the window to appear. To place the window in
   every workspace, click the All Workspaces check box. Click OK.
   Action for moving window between pages and monitors is the
   same. If Occupy dialog was called as "Occupy Workspace", mode
   of operation can be looped to "Occupy Page" or "Occupy Monitor"
   by pressing it's radio button left of the list of workspace,
   page or monitor objects.
     __________________________________________________________

3.3.2.2. Keyboard

   To display the Window Operations Menu, press Meta+Alt+M. Press
   the Down Arrow key to select "Occupy Workspace", then press
   Return. The Occupy Workspace dialog box appears. With Up or
   Down Arrow, select the workspace in which you want the window
   to appear. Press Return.
     __________________________________________________________

3.3.3. Renaming Workspaces

3.3.3.1. Mouse

   Click the Front Panel Workspace Manager button of the workspace
   whose name you want to change with third mouse button to
   display button's contextual menu. Click on Rename .... The
   button becomes a text field. Edit the workspace's name in the
   text field. Once the workspace is renamed, press Ctrl+Return on
   the keyboard to convert text field back to button.
     __________________________________________________________

3.3.3.2. Keyboard

   Press Ctrl+Backspace twice: first time to focus Front Panel,
   then second time to get mouse pointer into the middle of
   Workspace Manager. Press the TAB key to position pointer above
   workspace intended for renaming. Press Return to select (and
   change) the workspace. Press the Press the Ctrl+Space. The
   button becomes a text field. Edit the workspace's name in the
   text field. Once the workspace is renamed, press Ctrl+Return to
   convert text field back into button.
     __________________________________________________________

3.4. Using Menus

   Menus provide access to commands you use to manage windows and
   operate software applications.

   Choosing a menu item performs an associated action on the
   currently selected object. For example, when you select a
   window and choose Iconify from its Window menu, the window
   becomes an icon.

   Not all menu options are available at any time and under all
   circumstances. Where the action doesn't make a sense, action
   will be absent from the menu. In CDE, option is displayed as
   dimmed, but in NsCDE both is the case: some options which FVWM
   manages can appear dimmed, while other will be complitely
   missing from the menu.

   FVWM menus can be "teared off" and temporary converted into a
   window. By pressing Backspace while menu popup is active and
   focused, menu will turn into a simple widow with title bar
   which will contain internal menu name as window name and the
   title bar menu button on the left side of the title bar.

   Menus used by applications include:

     * Menus that you "pull down" from an application's menu bar
       by clicking the menu's name or typing Alt and its mnemonic.
       A mnemonic is an underlined character in a menu or item
       name. This has really nothing with NsCDE, but depends on
       gui toolkit used to build application. Like GTK2, GTK3 or
       Qt4, Qt5 ...
     * The same goes for contextual menus that "pop up" when you
       click mouse button 3 in an application window.
     __________________________________________________________

3.4.1. Window Operations Menu

   Figure 7. Standard and Extended Window Operations Menu

   back.
     __________________________________________________________

3.5.2. Restarting NsCDE desktop

   Sometimes, while changing parameters in NsCDE.conf or upgrading
   NsCDE, or because of some problem, it is necessary to restart
   NsCDE and FVWM. There are two dialogs and 3 ways to do this.

   Restart with System Action Dialog:

     * Click on the Exit icon right bottom of the Workspace
       Manager, or choose Log out ... from the bottom of the
       Workspace Menu. Workspace Menu can be invoked with mouse
       button 1, or by opening menu by pressing Menu+Menu, that
       is, Menu key twice. Item Log out ...can be choosen with the
       "g" mnemonic, or clicked with the mouse button 1.
     * System Action dialog appears. From the popup select X
       Window System: Window Manager Restart with mouse button 1,
       or Arrow Up and Arrow Down keys.
     * Click Confirm or press Ctrl+Return to confirm. FVWM and
       NsCDE restarts.

   Restart with Restart dialog:

     * Press Menu+Menu or click with mouse button 3 on the empty
       space of the backdrop to get Workspace Menu. Choose Restart
       NsCDE ... near the bottom of the Workspace Menu. This can
       be done with mouse pointer 1, or by pressing the "r"
       mnemonic.
     * Restart dialog appears with the question "Restart NsCDE".
       Click the Ok button or press Return. FVWM and NsCDE
       restarts.

   [fig_Restart.png]

   Restart from the terminal command line:

     * From the Front Panel's default fourth button click the icon
       of the terminal, or from Workspace Menu choose Terminal to
       open default terminal emulator.
     * Terminal window appears. Type nscde_fvwmclnt Restart and
       press return. FVWM and NsCDE restarts.
     __________________________________________________________

3.5.3. Logout from NsCDE and X session

     * Click on the Exit icon right bottom of the Workspace
       Manager, or choose Log out ... from the bottom of the
       Workspace Menu. Workspace Menu can be invoked with mouse
       button 1, or by opening menu by pressing Menu+Menu, that
       is, Menu key twice. Item Log out ...can be choosen with the
       "g" mnemonic, or clicked with the mouse button 1.
     * System Action dialog appears. From the popup select X
       Window System: Logout with mouse button 1, or Arrow Up and
       Arrow Down keys.
     * Click Confirm or press Ctrl+Return to confirm.

   Logout from the terminal command line:

     * From the Front Panel's default fourth button click the icon
       of the terminal, or from Workspace Menu choose Terminal to
       open default terminal emulator.
     * Terminal window appears. Type nscde_fvwmclnt Quit and press
       return. Note that this option will not perform any
       housekeeping.
     __________________________________________________________

3.5.4. Suspend the system

     * Click on the Exit icon right bottom of the Workspace
       Manager, then choose Suspend System ... with mouse or Arrow
       Up/Arrow Down keys, or choose Suspend System ... from the
       bottom of the Workspace Menu. Workspace Menu can be invoked
       with mouse button 1, or by opening menu by pressing
       Menu+Menu, that is, Menu key twice. Item Suspend System
       ...can be choosen with the "s" mnemonic, or clicked with
       the mouse button 1.
     * In the later case, System Action dialog appears. With
       Operating System: Suspend/Sleep menu item already selected.
       In the former case, it must be selected with keyboard or
       mouse as described above.
     * Click Confirm or press Ctrl+Return to confirm.

   Suspend from the terminal command line can vary across
   different flavors of Unix and even Linux. NsCDE implements
   wrapper $NSCDE_LIBDIR/acpimgr for portable way to do system
   suspend, hiberbate, hybrid suspend, poweroff/shutdown and
   reboot. Notice however that this wrapper must be called with
   sudo(8) or pfexec(1) on systems which are not detecting and
   implementing local user recognition policy like Linux systems
   with systemd(1).

   Generally, one of this should work:
$NSCDE_LIBDIR/acpimgr suspend


   or
sudo $NSCDE_LIBDIR/acpimgr suspend


   For the second example to work, a proper sudo(1) authorizations
   for the user or group must be implemented on the system. For
   such example, see
   $NSCDE_ROOT/share/doc/nscde/examples/sudo/006_PowerManager.
     __________________________________________________________

3.5.5. Reboot the system

     * Click on the Exit icon right bottom of the Workspace
       Manager, or choose Log out ... from the bottom of the
       Workspace Menu. Workspace Menu can be invoked with mouse
       button 1, or by opening menu by pressing Menu+Menu, that
       is, Menu key twice. Item Log out ...can be choosen with the
       "g" mnemonic, or clicked with the mouse button 1.
     * System Action dialog appears. From the popup select
       Operating System: Reboot with mouse button 1, or Arrow Up
       and Arrow Down keys.
     * Click Confirm or press Ctrl+Return to confirm.

   Reboot from the terminal command line can vary across different
   flavors of Unix and even Linux. NsCDE implements wrapper
   $NSCDE_LIBDIR/acpimgr for portable way to do system suspend,
   hiberbate, hybrid suspend, poweroff/shutdown and reboot. Notice
   however that this wrapper must be called with sudo(8) or
   pfexec(1) on systems which are not detecting and implementing
   local user recognition policy like Linux systems with
   systemd(1).

   Calling NsCDE acpimgr directly should work in one or more of
   this ways:
$NSCDE_LIBDIR/acpimgr reboot


   or
sudo $NSCDE_LIBDIR/acpimgr reboot


   For the second example to work, a proper sudo(1) authorizations
   for the user or group must be implemented on the system. For
   such example, see
   $NSCDE_ROOT/share/doc/nscde/examples/sudo/006_PowerManager.
     __________________________________________________________

3.5.6. Shutdown the system

     * Click on the Exit icon right bottom of the Workspace
       Manager, or choose Log out ... from the bottom of the
       Workspace Menu. Workspace Menu can be invoked with mouse
       button 1, or by opening menu by pressing Menu+Menu, that
       is, Menu key twice. Item Log out ...can be choosen with the
       "g" mnemonic, or clicked with the mouse button 1.
     * System Action dialog appears. From the popup select
       Operating System: Shutdown with mouse button 1, or Arrow Up
       and Arrow Down keys.
     * Click Confirm or press Ctrl+Return to confirm.

   Shutdown from the terminal command line can vary across
   different flavors of Unix and even Linux. NsCDE implements
   wrapper $NSCDE_LIBDIR/acpimgr for portable way to do system
   suspend, hiberbate, hybrid suspend, poweroff/shutdown and

   implementing local user recognition policy like Linux systems
   with systemd(1).

   Calling NsCDE acpimgr directly should work in one or more of
   this ways:
$NSCDE_LIBDIR/acpimgr poweroff


   or
sudo $NSCDE_LIBDIR/acpimgr poweroff


   For the second example to work, a proper sudo(1) authorizations
   for the user or group must be implemented on the system. For
   such example, see

4. Applets Docks and Panels

4.1. Front Panel

   Front Panel is the control area of the NsCDE desktop. It
   provides point-and-click access to the number of often used
   applications on the system. Front Panel hosts Workspace Manager
   and it displays information such as time and date, system load,
   and so on. Front Panel can be customized to include custom
   favorite applications. Front Panel can be moved or iconified,
   it's position changed, as well as number of buttons, Workspace
   Manager position, subpanels etc ...

   Figure 13. Front Panel

   [fig_fp.png]

   In NsCDE, CDE Front Panel is re-implemented with the help of
   FvwmButtons(1) Configuration is stored under alias *FrontPanel
   in FrontPanel.fvwm2.fvwmconf and FrontPanel.fvwm3.fvwmconf,
   read and activated from the Main.fvwmconf. Visually, this
   remake of Front Panel matches almost in a pixel CDE Front
   Panel. The main differences are:

     * Since FvwmButtons doesn't implement drag and drop protocol,
       there is no possibility to install icons by dragging them
       from file manager or from one to another position. However,
       icons (with their applications) on the Front Panel can be
       customized by clicking any item on the subpanel above it
       with the right mouse button. Dinamic contextual menu with
       the name of the application will appear and action Copy to
       Main Panel can be choosen. This will edit file
       FrontPanel.actions in user's $FVWM_USERDIR and put
       appropriate custom launcher. Another possibility is to use
       Front Panel Icon Manager: Change This Button can be choosen
       from the contextual menu with third mouse button: from
       here, a new icon and action can be choosen. All Front Panel
       launchers can be customized, including the ones with
       applets (clock, calendar, mail) instead of static icons.
       File FrontPanel.actions can also be edited manually as an
       alternative (caution should be taken) to achieve the same
       effect. Manual editing is mandatory when one wants to
       install new applets instead of static icons, because this
       cannot be done with gui menu actions. See
       FrontPanel.actions for examples. The other way (full
       control) is by copying FrontPanel.actions configuration
       file from $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm to $FVWM_USERDIR, but this is
       not recommended because any fixes or additions in the
       system FrontPanel.actions will not be seen by the user.
     * In the original CDE, Front Panel is part of the dtwm Window
       Manager binary, while in NsCDE it is configuration of
       FvwmButtons(1) FVWM module. Workspace Manager in the middle
       of the Front Panel is a separate applet written in
       FvwmScript(1).
     * On every icon, for the first two mouse buttons different
       action can be assigned. This is used for example 7th icon
       where mouse button 1 calls Style Manager, while hidden
       action on mouse button 2 calls Backdrop Style Manager
       directly as a quick shortcut. Second (middle) mouse button
       action can be considered as hidden hack for advanced usage.
     * Mouse button 3 on any of the default 10 Front Panel icons
       brings contextual pop-up menu titled by the main action
       from mouse button 1. Action on this menu are:
         a. Call main application by name as if icon has been
            clicked with the 1st mouse button.
         b. Reset This Button which will remove user's
            customizations for that launcher button from the
            $FVWM_USERDIR/FrontPanel.actions and load default from
            the $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/FrontPanel.actions.
         c. Move Button Left, Move Buttom At The Beginning, Move
            Button Right, Move Button To The End options will move
            current button (and it's subpanel if enabled) one
            place to the right or left. Leftmost button, if moved
            left will end up on the end of the Front Panel, wile
            rightmost button, if moved to the right will end up at
            the beginning of the Front Panel.
         d. Reset Subpanel will reset upper subpanel to it's
            default value (remove definition of the numbered
            subpanel from the $FVWM_USERDIR/Subpanels.actions),
         e. Delete Subpanel will disable subpanel for above this
            icon (without resetting user's configuration for it),
            and
         f. Help will try to find matching man page for a button's
            command or appropriate part of NsCDE documentation if
            the entry is the NsCDE component. Failing this, it
            will display this document. Documentation is displayed
            as HTML in the default documentation browser.
       Figure 14. Front Panel Launcher Context Menu
       [fig_fp_ctx_menu.png]
     * In addition to iconification, Front Panel can be shaded to
       the bottom edge of the screen with Shift+Backspace action,
       and put back in it's place with the same key binding when
       it is called again. Shade direction of the Front Panel is
       the opposite one from ordinary windows - they are rolled
       from the bottom up.
     * Iconification is by default to bottom right screen edge,
       leaving last 96px space to the right for Stalonetray the
       while all other programs are by default iconified in the
       top left edge as in CDE.
     * NsCDE Front Panel is flexible. It can be overlapped with
       programs, moves away (lower) for fully maximized windows
       and while pretty much thick, it is not in the user's way on
       the screen.
     * Front Panel has it's own menu on the top left button and
       special context menu if this button is clicked with right
       mouse button. Middle mouse button behaves as if title bar
       of a any normal window is clicked - with special diagnostic
       tool menu. Right-clicked special menu has this important
       tasks:
          + Calls Workspace and Page Manager Manager
          + Restart WorkSpace Manager
          + Restart Page Manager
          + Number of Launchers ... (submenu)
          + Restart Panel Clock (pclock)
          + Restart Panel Mail Applet
          + Restart Panel Date (MonthDayApplet)
          + Restart Panel Lite (FpLite)
          + Restart the (whole) Front Panel
          + Help
       Figure 15. Front Panel Menu and Front Panel Controls Menu
       [fig_fp_menu.png]
       This menu can also be called from the customized Window
       Options Menu which appears if menu button is clicked with
       the left mouse button. Item Front Panel Controls will
       replace Window Options Menu with Front Panel Controls Menu.
     * As FvwmButtons based dock, by default it swallows the
       following applets:
          + fpclock (external standalone app with CDEish skin)
          + MonthDayApplet (FvwmScript)
          + CheckMailApplet (FvwmScript)
          + WSM / Workspace Manager (FvwmScript)
          + FpLite (FvwmScript)
     * Third icon expects $[infostore.filemgr] to be defined or
       discovered and automatically filled if not defined.
     * Fourth icon will call $[infostore.terminal] which must be
       defined or it is discovered.
     * Sixth icon tries to discover system print manager.
       Currently, only system-config-printer and
       $[infostore.browser] http://localhost:631 are discovered,
       but this can be set manually by putting InfoStore variable
       $[infostore.printmgr] in ~/.NsCDE/NsCDE.conf. Good place
       for personal custom icon and redefinition if printing
       really doesn't that much to the user.
     * Seventh: NsCDE Style Manager from which all other Style
       Managers can be called.
     * If some of the file managers which is capable to present
       menu://applications/ namespace, eighth Front Panel button
       will act as a sort of Application Manager and call
       $[infostore.appmgr]. Currently, only pcmanfm and pcmanfm-qt
       are known to support this namespace. Note however that you
       cannot drag and drop applications into Front Panel or it's
       subpanels, because FvwmButtons(1) does not implement
       drag-and-drop protocol. A stand alone drag and drop
       receiver is planned for the future, which will be capable
       to execute arbitrary action when DnD message is received,
       and this will be implemented then.
       If niether of this file managers is not installed, icon on
       this launcher will appear as editor icon and
       $[infostore.xeditor] - if defined in
       $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf. will be launched when clicked
       with the first mouse button. If $[infostore.xeditor] is not
       defined, NsCDE will try to find some usable app from it's
       static fallback catalog and autofill this value on startup.
     * Semi-empty. By default, it only popups 9th subpanel if
       pressed. A nice idea is to call pavucontrol or some audio
       mixer on 3rd mouse click from FrontPanel.actions.
     * Help, documentation.
     * Front Panel Subpanels 2, 5, 6 and 8 are empty by default,
       but they can be activated with a triple middle pointer
       click on an empty place, or with a contextual menu on the
       icon below it on the Front Panel, and selecting a menu item
       "Add Subpanel". In a former case, dialog will ask user if
       he wants subpanel to be enabled, while in later case,
       subpanel will be enabled immediately. This is specially
       useful for subpanel 5 which will show
       $[infostore.mailreader] if it is defined or autodiscovered.
          + Subpanel 1: Communications
          + Subpanel 3: Office Tools - Components and various
            office/productivity tools (PS/PDF reades etc ...)
          + Subpanel 4: Tools
          + Subpanel 7: Desktop Settings - NsCDE Style Manager and
            various Qt, Gtk and misc desktop management
            applications
          + Subpanel 9: Graphics and Multimedia - photo, drawing,
            audio and video programs ...
          + Subpanel 10: Help - Documentation
     * In the center of the Front Panel there is a place without
       subpanel launchers and separated by vertical line. Inside
       this area, there are 4 small command icons: Left: Lock
       Screen (xscreensaver -activate), Page Manager Menu, Right
       are Front Panel Lite (system load indicator), and Exit
       button (SysActionDialog).
       Lock Screen icon (upper left) has a contextual menu invoked
       by the 3rd mouse button click, which allows user to suspend
       and resume background activity of the xscreensaver(1) in
       addition to the locking mechanism. Help menu entry is also
       present. Mouse button 2 brings Xscreensaver preferences
       dialog as if it was called from the Style Manager.
       Page Manager Menu icon has a contextual menu invoked by the
       3rd mouse button click. In addition to returning back to
       main menu, it can call visual local FVWM pager LocalPager.
       Help menu entry is present too. Mouse button 2 brings
       Workspaces and Pages Style Manager configuration.
       Front Panel Lite (upper right) has a small contextual menu
       which calls main action and help.
       Exit button (lower right) has a small contextual menu which
       calls main action and help.
       In the middle of this area there is WSM - Work Space
       Manager with well known buttons for navigating NsCDE
       workspaces. By default, four workspaces are shown and
       configured, but this can be changed (see Section 4.3).
     __________________________________________________________

4.1.1. Customizing number of Front Panel launchers

   NsCDE Front Panel can be customized to contain from zero to 20
   Front Panel buttons or launchers. Default is 10 (5 launchers
   left and 5 launchers right from the Workspace Manager). There
   can be even or unequal number of launchers on any side of the
   Front Panel. Limit is 10 launchers per one side (Workspace
   Manager is the middle) of the Front Panel. That way, it is
   possible to:

     * Extend number of launchers (buttons)
     * Move Workspace Manager to left or right
     * Reduce number of launchers
     * Extend or reduce number of subpanels on active launchers
     * All extended (more than 5 on each side) launchers can be
       customized with icons, subpanels and swallowed applets.

   This is very flexible scheme, and can scale from minimal
   two-workspaces configuration without any launcher (just left
   and right handlers, and Workspace Manager with Lock, FpLite,
   Exit and Page Manager in the middle), up to configuration with
   20 launchers freely arranged left and right with up to eight
   workspaces. For this last one, Full HD resolution, or at least
   1680x1050 is needed.

   To change number of launchers left or right of the Workspace
   Manager, leftmost menu button of the Front Panel must be
   selected, which will bring Window Options Menu, then Front
   Panel Controls can be selected to replace Window Options Menu.
   Front Panel Controls can be directly called by clicking this
   same button with third (right) mouse button. Next, Number of
   Launchers ... submenu must be opened.

   Actions are:

     * Add Left Launcher
     * Add Right Launcher
     * Remove Left Launcher
     * Remove Right Launcher
     * Help

   Figure 16. New Front Panel Launcher and it's new icon with
   action

   [fig_fp_launcher.png]
   Once a new launcher is on the Front Panel, it can be customized
   in the following ways:

    a. Clicking on a gray empty icon handler. The Front Panel Icon
       Manager will appear. Here, new action (program) with it's
       icon or custom icon can be choosen.
    b. Temporary or permanently enabling subpanel, installing
       icons on it with Subpanel Manager, then using Copy to Main
       Panel function from the contextual menu popped up with
       third mouse button on the new item on subpanel. Icon will
       be installed in the Front Panel. One can leave subpanel
       enabled, or disable it back.
    c. By manual editing of the configuration in
       $FVWM_USERDIR/FrontPanel.actions and restarting Front Panel
       to pick up new preferences.

   Under the hood, adding or removing number of launchers on the
   Front Panel is actually editing FVWM InfoStore variables
   FP.LeftLaunchersNum and FP.RightLaunchersNum in the
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf which are both by default 5. Front
   Panel geometry is automatically recalculated on restart.
     __________________________________________________________

4.2. Subpanels

   Figure 17. Front Panel with opened Subpanels

   [fig_subpanels.png]
   NsCDE subpanels are simple transient FvwmButtons based docks.
   As the Front Panel itself, they are also as much as possible
   similar to original CDE forms of the same purpose. Some
   applications in them are predefined, and discovered if
   installed, and the rest is up to user to populate. Their
   purpose is not to show all possible GUI applications installed
   on the system as right-clicked Workspace Menu does. They are
   meant for favorite, important and often used programs.

   There is one big difference between CDE and NsCDE subpanels:
   Install Icon is not (and cannot be due to FvwmButtons not
   implementing) drag-and-drop destionation. Click action on
   Install Icon calls special NsCDE tool Subpanels Manager for
   installing, that is, defining items on the subpanel. There is
   no drag and drop off items from the applicaton manager (the
   later also doesn't exist, but it can be used as
   menu://applications/ pseudo path in some file managers).

   On every subpanel, last selected entry will remain hilighted
   next time subpanel is popped up again.

   Each Subpanel's application item or entry has additional third
   mouse pointer button action which will pop up dinamically
   populated contextual menu named after item's title. Here, the
   following actions are available:

     * Application Entry Name (varies): clicking it will have the
       same effect as first mouse button click This is a kind of a
       escape from the contextual menu, but to still use
       subpanel's default action without repeating opening of a
       submenu again.
     * Move Up: move the current item one space up
     * Move Down: move the current item one space down
     * Move to Beginning: move the current item to top of the
       subpanel
     * Move to End: move the current item to bottom of the
       subpanel
     * Copy to Main Panel: Promote item icon to the main panel as
       bigger icon, keeping it's function
     * Rename: Rename the current item on the subpanel
     * Delete: Delete the current item from the subpanel (warning
       message will appear before deletion is finally performed)
     * Help: Display relevant documentation in a documentation
       browser: this will try to find a matching man page for the
       subpanel's entry command or appropriate part of NsCDE
       documentation if the entry is the NsCDE component. Failing
       this, it will display this document.

   Figure 18. Front Panel Item Context Menu

   [fig_subpanel_ctx_menu.png]
   If move or delete action is silently not performed, this is
   most likely the situation where user's
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Subpanels.actions is newer than
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Subpanels.fvwmX.fvwmconf, and must be rebuilt for
   configuration actions to take a place properly. In that case,
   repeated operation must succeed, otherwise, see X session error
   log for details.

   Subpanels, like in CDE has titlebars but as windows on screen
   they are without borders and handles. They have only left menu
   button like other windows, but with one exception: there are no
   actions for closing window and re-positioning it (no sense in
   this), but they have "Refresh Subpanel" and "Subpanel Settings"
   controls. First one kills process module, re-reads it's
   configuration and starts it on the next click on Front Panel
   subpanel launcher. Subpanel Settings is the small and simple
   FvwmScript tool which allows one to rename Subpanel, set it's
   width for application item titles to fit if necessary, and to
   enable or disable that particular Subpanel.

   On the first change with Install Icon or Subpanel Settings,
   non-FVWM configuration file Subpanels.actions will be created
   in the $FVWM_USERDIR, from there, all subpanels changed from
   default will be read by the $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/generate_subpanels,
   while the rest will be generated and combined/mixed from the
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/Subpanels.actions. This file can also
   be edited by hand (ok, not by hand, but editor will suffice)
   and the result may be applied by calling generate_subpanels and
   then f_ReadCfg Subpanels. Generated files will be called
   Subpanels.fvwm2.fvwmconf and Subpanels.fvwm3.fvwmconf with the
   same content, but a slightly different syntax, one of this
   files will be read as subpanels configuration depending under
   which version of FVWM NsCDE is running. This files are expected
   to appear in the $FVWM_USERDIR. If not found there,
   $NSCDE_ROOT/config/Subpanels.fvwmX.fvwmconf will be read
   instead. Syntax of the Subpanels.actions is explained in the
   Configuration files explained section.

   Presently, there is one workaround here under FVWM2: as much as
   FVWM, and specially FvwmButtons are very flexible and
   configurable, no title for the buttons app can be set apart
   from module alias, but module alias doesn't support names with
   spaces in them. Internal names as "NsCDE-SubpanelX" are for
   that reason referenced in FrontPanel.fvwmX.fvwmconf, and are
   internally mandatory names of their Subpanels. Because there is
   no configuration option in FVWM2 for subpanel to set Window
   Title, we are using tool xdotool(1) which is run on Subpanel
   initialization with a delay of 3,2 seconds (internal workaround
   for xdotool) and this then takes infostore variable
   NsCDE-SubpanelX-Name and sets literal, system default or user
   picked name of the subpanel. Presently, an alternative option
   is to apply FvwmButtons patch present in the patches
   subdirectory of NsCDE tarball which introduces a WindowName
   option for FVWM2 to it's configuration, or even better, to use
   new FVWM3 which has this and many other handy options and
   capabilities already in place.

   The rest about Subpanel, or to say their visible outfit, and
   their main function are the same as in CDE - a nice,
   heavyweight and elegant application launchers.

4.3. Workspace Manager

   Figure 19. Front Panel Workspace Manager

   [fig_wsm.png]

   Workspace Manager is a Widget in the center of the Front Panel.
   Visually, it replicates in almost a pixel similarity with the
   center of the CDE's Workspace Manager's buttons, but with a few
   exceptions beneath the surface and further configuration:

     * There is a limited number for possible of workspaces. There
       can be no odd number of workspaces, and combinations are:
       2, 4, 6 and 8. Default is of course 4.
       Figure 20. Workspace Manager for setup with 6 Workspaces
       [fig_wsm6.png]
     * If InfoStore variable wsm.eco is defined as "InfoStoreAdd
       wsm.eco 1" in user's profile $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf, WSM
       buttons will not be fixed in width as in CDE. In that case,
       Workspace Manager will not extend a width of the Front
       Panel, rather buttons will be more wide in 2-buttons
       combination, and more narrow in 6 and specially 8 button
       combination. By default, buttons are all of the same width
       and they are extending or narrowing the cummulative Front
       Panel width size if changed from default 4 workspaces to 2,
       6 or 8 workspaces.
     * As in CDE, workspace names can be renamed. There is a
       keyboard combination in FvwmScript WSM which enters rename
       mode: Ctrl+Space on the current active workspace button,
       while pointer is above it. Then, Ctrl+Enter saves a new
       name. Names are synchronized with FVWM desktop names and
       used in the rest of the configuration. Names are saved in
       $FVWM_USERDIR/WSM.conf, and EWMH desktop names are applied
       immediately in a existing X11 NsCDE session. Workspaces can
       also enter rename mode if their workspace buttons are
       clicked with 3rd mouse button and Rename ... option choosen
       from the popup menu.
       [fig_wsp_rename.png]
       [fig_wsp_renamed.png]
     * If Sun type keyboard is in use, Help key above WSM will
       bring this help text in documentation browser. On PC
       keyboard, F1 has the same function.
     * Addition: right mouse button on workspace button brings
       contextual menu. From this menu, the following items can be
       selected:
         a. Default acion (activate workspace),
         b. Rename ... to rename the workspace
         c. Manage ... to call Workspace and Page Style Manager
            Popup menu
         d. Submenu item Go to Page ... for changing the active
            page on the that workspace, which will of course
            change active workspace to that where page was
            selected.
         e. Local Pager, Local Pager (visual FvwmPager) (for a
            workspace, not necessarily the current one)
         f. The last option Windows ... to bring up Window List
            menu, with window items for that workspace
       Figure 21. Workspace Manager Button Popup
       [fig_wsm_popup.png]
     * Number of Workspaces and Pages can be configured with the
       Workspace and Pages Style Manager tool.

   State of the buttons is synchronized by FVWM function called
   from FvwmEvent(1) module whenever desks and pages are changed
   by other means, such as keyboard shortcut, mouse move, or by
   issuing direct commands to FvwmCommand(1).

   In 4-color palette mode, all WSM buttons are of the same color,
   while in 8-colors mode, there are four color variations from
   the given palette.

   Workspaces in NsCDE are named and numbered from 1, while in
   FVWM (where they are called desks), they start from 0. This
   fact required additional effort while coding FvwmScripts and
   making core configurations.
     __________________________________________________________

4.4. Page Manager

   Page Manager is entirely new thing. There is no concept of
   Pages in the original CDE, just workspaces (FVWM: desks). A
   nice FVWM feature of pages is too useful to be disabled and
   sacrificed just for the sake of even more CDE similarity, but
   really zealous user can configure NsCDE not to use pages, just
   workspaces. That is, 1 page per workspace. PGM is a dynamic
   FvwmButtons Icon southwest from the WSM, represented by the
   silver-gray icon of the workspace divided on pagesX x pagesY.
   Default is 2x2, that is, four pages per every workspace, which
   in default setup gives 4 x 4 = 16 screens for applications.
   Minimum for pages is 0, and maximum 16. For example, in maximal
   workspaces+pages configuration, one gets 8x16 desktop, that is
   128 screens! While undoubtedly this is diversion from a even
   more flexible plain FVWM configuration, it covers really great
   number of possible preferences. Pages can be configured in any
   XxY combination. For example 1x4, 2x3, 3x3, 2x1, 2x2, 3x2 ...

   Figure 22. Page Manager Menu

   [fig_pgmgr_menu.png]

   Figure 23. Page Manager Context Menu

   [fig_pages_menu.png]

   Page Manager icon changes with the page to represent position
   of the current page on current workspace while user moves from
   page to page automatically with the help of the FvwmEvent(1)
   just like the Workspace Manager (WSM).

   When clicked, popups menu with names of the pages. When option
   from the menu is selected, menu pops down and active pointer
   screen is changed to the selected page. Second pointer button
   calls Workspace and Page Manager, while the third pointer
   button calls pages popup menu.
     __________________________________________________________

4.5. MonthDayApplet

   [fig_month_day_applet.png]

   Familiar CDE icon with month and day of the month in it. Simple
   applet which calls empty, do-nothing (by default) function
   f_Calendar. This function can be overridden in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Functions.fvwmlocal to call a program configured
   by the user.

   If Sun type keyboard is in use, Help key above Month Day Applet
   will bring this help text in documentation browser. On PC
   keyboard, F1 has the same function.
     __________________________________________________________

4.6. Front Panel Clock - fpclock

   [fig_fpclock.png]

   This is a small C program (GPL) written many years ago by
   Alexander Kourakos. It supports XPM skins and displays hours,
   minutes and seconds. It is well suited for window manager docks
   like FvwmButtons(1). In NsCDE it is applied with a skin similar
   to original one, but slightly bigger and with more clear edges
   and colors. Default can be used from $NSCDE_DATADIR/icons/NsCDE
   or even replaced with a Solaris version with picture of the
   globe with red hands for hours and minutes and white for
   seconds. If clicked, it will try to execute firefox by default
   (which appears doesn't work if Num Lock is active on the
   keyboard).
     __________________________________________________________

4.7. Check Mail Applet

   [fig_check_mail_applet.png]

   Fifth icon from the left on Front Panel is FvwmScript applet.
   It is calling f_CheckMail FVWM function if clicked. By default
   f_CheckMail is calling $[infostore.mailreader], which if
   defined by user or discovery, will bring up mail application.
   Up to user is to redefine this variable in his
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Functions.fvwmlocal to suit the needs for mail
   checking. To be clear, by default, it is not functional as an
   new mail notification applet. External applications can use it
   for this by calling nscde_fvwmclnt to send it a signal. The
   syntax is:
nscde_fvwmclnt "SendToModule CheckMailApplet SendString 1 2 \
 LetterUp <accnum> <accname> <fontsize> <color>"


   Where:

     * nscde_fvwmclnt is NsCDE wrapper for FVWM2 or FVWM3
       FvwmCommand sender
     * "SendToModule CheckMailApplet SendString 1 2" will send
       directions to widget 1, subroutine 2 of the CheckMailApplet
       FvwmScript module
     * "accnum" is a number identifying a separate mail account or
       entity, one per name, 10 max
     * "accname" is 3 letters identifying account, for example
       "PTN" for proton
     * "fontsize" can send font size hint to CheckMailApplet for
       displaying notification info
     * "color" is a hex or X11 color name hint to CheckMailApplet
       for displaying notification info

   This command can be used by mail programs to notify Front Panel
   Mail icon to change from closed letter to open letter when new
   mail arrives. For any new mail, counter for named and numbered
   account will increase by 1, until icon is clicked by the user.
   For example, Thunderbird has a "mailbox alert" extension that
   can use scripting way of sending notifications.

   Above this applet, there is an empty space for subpanel
   launcher which can be activated with middle triple click, and
   it will present Mail Reader if thunderbird, claws-mail, mutt or
   some other popular and known mail application is installed.
   User can use Install Icon action to change or add entries on
   this menu. For example, to call urxvt -e mutt or something like
   that.

   Key F1 will bring this help text in documentation browser. If
   Sun type keyboard is in use, Help key above Check Mail Applet
   has the same function as F1 on PC.
     __________________________________________________________

4.8. FpLite

   [fig_fplite.png]

   Load Indicator on the top right side of the center of the Front
   Panel contains a small applet called FpLite. In original CDE it
   was used to indicate desktop activity, but since on today's
   processors this tasks are short and almost immediate (specially
   with a good window manager such as FVWM), It appears to be
   better suited to server as system load indicator.

   It has 10 micro-bars. When there is no load, all are yellow.
   Load grows from left to right. First 5 green bars, then 3 blue,
   2 magenta, an after that it starts from the beginning with red
   bars. FpLite summarizes load of all CPUs on the system in a way
   that 1-minute load is divided with number of CPU cores, and
   then counted as such while displaying load with color
   micro-bars. Everything under 1 (internally 100) is yellow,
   green, blue and magenta, and after that it counts 10 red
   micro-bars. For example: on the system with 2 CPU cores,
   1-minute load of 0.6 will be presented with 3 bars (0.6 /
   num-cores), load of 2.2 will be presented with one red bar etc
   ... on the system with four CPU cores load of 3 will be magenta
   on the two rightmost bars, and load of 4 or more will be red.
   Load of more than (numcpu * 10) will not be shown specially,
   but user gets an idea what is going on if FpLite is all red.

   If clicked, it will call a function f_FpLiteClickAction which
   is by default set to $[infostore.taskmgr] or autodiscovery
   during starup. If nothing else, it will call [default terminal
   app] -e top on Linux and BSD systems, [default terminal app] -e
   prstat on Solaris and it's clones, and [default terminal app]
   -e topas on AIX. FpLite FvwmScript app uses little portable
   python script getla1 from the $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/libexec to obtain
   1-minute load data.

   Key F1 will bring this help text in documentation browser. If
   Sun type keyboard is in use, Help key above FpLite has the same
   function as F1 on PC.

5. GUI Tools

5.1. Style Manager

   Figure 24. Style Manager

   [fig_stylemgr.png]

   This Window is a starting point for all other Style Manager
   applications to be called. It is called from 7th button on the
   Front Panel. It has big icons for calling:

     * Color Style Manager
     * Font Style Manager
     * Backdrop Style Manager
     * Keyboard Style Manager
     * Mouse Style Manager
     * Beep Style Manager
     * Screen Style Manager (Xscreensaver)
     * Window Style Manager
     * Workspaces and Pages Style Manager
     * Power Style Manager
     * Startup Style Manager

   If NsCDE was started by some X Session Manager, Startup Style
   Manager icon will call setup tool for that session manager or
   DE if it is known to Style Manager. Otherwise, error message is
   displayed: either that NsCDE was not started under X Session
   Management, or X Session Manager is not recognized, and it's
   setup tool cannot be run. Currently, only MATE, LXDE, KDE and
   GNOME session managers are recognized and their respective
   tools called. See Section 13 about running NsCDE under X
   Session Manager for more information about this matter.

5.2. Backdrop Style Manager

   Figure 25. Backdrop Style Manager

   [fig_backdropmgr.png]

   Part of the Style Managers which can be called from the main
   Style Manager (7th button on the Front Panel). This is the
   clone of the same-named CDE tool. It loads backdrops from the
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/backdrops and $FVWM_USERDIR/backdrops (if any).
   From XPM backdrop templates with symbol names (with .pm
   extension) it will generate previews in user's
   $FVWM_USERDIR/tmp and if applied or OK'ed, will set permanent
   backdrop in $FVWM_USERDIR/backer. Backer is named after
   FvwmBacker(1) module which then loads this X Pixmap as numbered
   FVWM Colorset from the $FVWM_USERDIR/Backdrops.fvwmgen which
   will be written by Backdrop Style Manager (or by hand).
   Backdrops are generated in the colors of the current color
   theme from the active palette (Broica by default). It has
   different colors for a group of every four desktops in 8-colors
   mode and the same base color in 4-color mode. Generated
   backdrop in the $FVWM_USERDIR/backer are named
   DeskN-<name-of-the-backdrop>.pm where N is the workspace (desk)
   number from 1-8. In such a way it is possible to have the same
   backdrop pattern on more than one workspace in 8-colors mode.

   In case of NsCDE setup with FVWM3 and per-monitor or shared X
   RandR monitor model (fvwm3 DesktopConfiguration), backdrops in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/backer will be used as a source for procedure
   which builds joined tiled backdrops for multiple monitors.
   Output of this backdrops, which is then loaded directly by FVWM
   function is placed in $FVWM_USERDIR/backer/bgcache
   subdirectory.

   There is an option to use the same backdrop for all desks too.
   User can add and delete custom backdrops in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/backdrops. First action with Add button and file
   picker, and second action with Delete button when particular
   backdrop from the list on the right of the preview is selected.
   Delete action will fail for system-pathed backdrops with
   appropriate error message, while both actions will reload list
   of backdrops immediately. Apart from doing this, NsCDE Backdrop
   Style Manager has couple of features more than CDE original:

     * In 8-color mode, user can select another color variant
       instead of default for the current workspace from the popup
       menu. There are four variants.
     * Custom palette can be loaded instead of default one, and
       backdrops can be set with colors from that palette. In
       8-colors mode, there is even more possibility because
       colors can freely change their associated workspace.
     * Instead of backdrops, user can opt for a background image.
       If option "Use photo or picture" is selected, list of
       backdrops will dissapear and image backgrounds (so called
       "wallpapers") of PNG and XPM type will be loaded from
       $NSCDE_DATADIR/photos and from the $FVWM_USERDIR/photos (if
       any). Option to use one photo for all workspaces exists
       too. In this mode, backdrop-specific options will be hidden
       until Use photo or picture is not deselected. Add and
       Delete of photos/pictures is supported in a same way as for
       backdrops. Photos must be in PNG or XPM format to be
       loaded. This means that images of that type can be added to
       $FVWM_USERDIR/photos but if some other known format is
       added via Add button of Backdrop Style Manager, like JPG,
       TIFF or GIF, it will be converted to PNG on the fly.
       Pictures can be loaded as FVWM Colorset definition
       "Pixmap", "AspectPixmap" and "TiledPixmap". Default is
       "AspectPixmap" (in contrast to backdrops which are always
       TiledPixmap). This 3 options can be choosen on the popup
       menu.

   Key Bindings:

     * Ctrl+Q: Quits Backdrop Style Manager.
     * Ctrl+Return: Perform a change. Like if OK was pressed.
     * Sun Help and F1: Displays this help text.

5.2.1. Load Custom Palette Dialog

   A Backdrop Style Manager part

   Helper dialog which provides a list of palettes to the Backdrop
   Style Manager when user wants to use color schemes from another
   palette from currently used in user's setup. This is NsCDE
   addon functionality, not present in original CDE. Additionally,
   background variants from custom palettes can be used too as
   from the default user's palette in 8-color mode, which is also
   NsCDE feature not present in original CDE.

5.3. Beep Style Manager

   Simple tool to adjust system beep device - if it is present as
   device and if desired/enabled. This tool uses xset(1) b command
   to set volume, pitch and duration of the beep sound. Modified
   setting can be tested with additional Beep button which is not
   present in the original tool, and also dynamically applied with
   Apply button. Save button will save $FVWM_USERDIR/Xset.conf
   with other xset(1) options which are executed during NsCDE
   startup.

   Changing Beep Options

    I. Open Beep Style Manager Beep from the main Style Manager
       window.
   II. Select the settings you prefer:
          + Volume: Determines the volume of the beep (off at 0%)
          + Pitch (Hz): Determines the pitch of the beep from 82
            to 9000 Hz
          + Duration: Determines the time length of the beep sound
          + Beep Button (upper left) test the current settings
   III. To save the changes, click Save. To return to the default
       settings, click Default button at upper right corner of the
       window.

5.4. Screen Style Manager (Xscreensaver)

   Well known X screen saver is a perfect drop in as Screen Style
   Manager for NsCDE. It is more extended, fancier and more
   capable than original CDE screensaver. Xscreensaver has it's
   own configuration in ~/.xscreensaver. If this file does not
   exist during initial setup of the NsCDE, and if xscreensaver(1)
   is installed on the system, a default NsCDE version of the
   ~/.xscreensaver will be installed in user's home directory.
   Xscreensaver probably does not have much sense in virtual
   machines, but on notebooks and workstations it is almost
   mandatory as a locking mechanism with surplus value of nice
   animations.

   Xscreensaver's GUI configuration program xscreensaver-demo(1)
   can be called from the NsCDE Style Manager main window. It
   allows user to tune various acpects of the program's behaviour
   such as:

   Figure 28. Screen Style Manager (Xscreensaver setup)

   [fig_screenmgr.png]

     * Xscreensaver damon management
     * Locking or just blanking
     * Which screensaver animations (hacks) are enabled
     * Mode of operation (One animation only, random, blank screen
       only)
     * Cycling in random mode and blanking timers
     * Weather images of the desktop may be grabbed by certain
       animations (security concern)
     * Path to directory with photos which may be used in
       animations.
     * Text sources for manipulation by certail animations
     * Power management: this parameters are also set by the Power
       Style Manager
     * Fade in and fade out of the animations when screen is
       unlocked.

   X screen saver may be started with Meta+Alt+L or with the lock
   icon upper left from the Workspace Manager on the Front Panel.
   Screen may also be locked from the Workspace Menu with the
   option Lock Screen. For all this to work, usage of the
   xscreensaver must be enabled in the $HOME/.NsCDE/NsCDe.conf -
   nscde_use_xscreensaver must be set to 1.

5.5. Color Style Manager

   With Backdrop Style Manager, this is probably the most
   important theme tool in (Ns)CDE. This tool applies colors to
   the widgets, menus, applications and backdrops. As in CDE, it
   reads color information from the palette files in
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/palettes and $FVWM_USERDIR/palettes. Palettes
   are the 16bpp color definitions (8 of them). This colors and
   border bg/fg/sel colors calculated from them are the base of
   the look of pretty much all of the things on the screen. Colors
   can be applied in 4 or 8 colors mode. Most notable palettes are
   Broica in 8-colors mode and Solyaris (called Default on SunOS)
   in 4 colors mode. Color mode can be selected with the Number Of
   Colors dialog which opens when the same named button in the
   main dialog of Color Style Manager is pressed.

   Color Buttons and the Number of Colors selection determine the
   number of colors that make up a palette. You will have four or
   eight colors in the Color dialog box. The different color
   buttons in the palette control the colors used for different
   areas of the screen.

   Figure 30. Color Style Manager

   [fig_color_stylemgr.png]

   If you have eight color buttons, they will be used as follows
   (buttons numbered from left to right, top to bottom):

    I. Active window borders, corners and titlebars
   II. Inactive window borders and non-application menus
   III. Workspace Manager (WSM) Switch for workspace 1 and 5
   IV. Text, text field, list areas and text areas
    V. Main window background and Workspace 2 and 6 button
       background
   VI. Dialog box background, menu bar, popup menu and background
       of workspace 3 and 7
   VII. Workspace 4 and 8 background
   VIII. Front Panel background when "Color 8 for Front Panel and
       Icons" is selected in the "Number of Colors ..." subdialog.

   If you have four color buttons, they will be used as follows
   (buttons numbered from left to right):

    I. Active window borders
   II. Window bodies:
         a. Inactive window borders and non-application menus
         b. Main window and dialog box backgrounds and menu bar
         c. Front Panel background
   III. Workspace switches and backgrounds
   IV. Text, text field, list areas and text areas

   Color Style Manager as most tools is written in FvwmScript with
   background shell helper and color calculation and generator
   routines. Visually it tries to be as much as possible similar
   to the original CDE, but since it has some new features, there
   are some new buttons and commands introduced. Tool has a list
   of the palettes (system + user), preview button which can
   temporary apply some palette on the current workspace backdrop
   and FVWM based applications (FrontPanel, other scripts ...)

   As in Backdrop Style Manager there are Add and Delete button
   actions. System palettes cannot be deleted, while local can be
   added to $FVWM_USERDIR/palettes and applied immediately.

   Importing a ready-made new custom Palette: you can import your
   own palette

    I. Open the Color Style Manager.
   II. Choose Add ... in the Color dialog box.
   III. Browse files and directories to the new Palette file.
       Palette file must have .dp extension and conform to the
       simple format (8x16bpp hex colors).
   IV. Select the new Palette file from the list of files
    V. Click OK in the Color dialog box.

   Custom Palettes from the $FVWM_USERDIR/palettes can also be
   deleted. Just pick the name from the list and click on the
   Delete ... button. You will be asked for confirmation, and
   then, if standard UNIX filesystem user and group ownership and
   permissions are allowing that, palette file will be permanently
   deleted.

   Creating new palette by modifying an existing one makes a copy
   of the currently selected palette with a default name "Custom".
   When applying this new palette, Color Style Manager will ask
   you to rename this palette, which is a good idea, because the
   next modification will rewrite "Custom" generic name again, and
   previous work will be lost. You then create your custom palette
   by modifying the copy, so the original palette is not changed.

   Figure 31. Color Style Manager: Modify Color

   [fig_color_modcolor_stylemgr.png]

   Button Modify will popup color editor if user selects one of
   the 8 (or 4) base colors. When selected, this color frames will
   get "Abc" written in them with automatic foreground choice for
   that RGB/HSV combination. Frames can be unseleced by simply
   clicking on them again. When one base color is selected Modify
   will present editor with controls for Red, Green and Blue
   values, as well as Hue, Saturation and Value. On the top left
   corner are preview squares with names "Old" and "New". When
   changing color with RGB and/or HSV controls, this "New" square
   button will change it's colorset. Color can also be picked from
   any screen element with Grab Color button- If action is not
   Cancel but OK, selected color will be modified and new palette
   with generic name "Custom" created immediately. When finishing
   theme selection in Color Style Manager with modified colors,
   Color Style Manager will ask for a name of the new palette. The
   suggested default is "Custom" but on the subsequent
   modification, this is the palette which will be modified and
   past modifications will be effectively lost. For that reason,
   it is probably a good idea to save modified palette as new
   palette with some other name. In that way, it can be temporary
   changed for some other and turned back again later. This color
   modification dialog actually serves as palette creator (based
   on previous palettes) and editor.

   There are 8 spaces with colors from the currently selected
   palette (4 spaces in 4-color mode) and generated XPM file with
   all 40 colors displayed. Button Number of Colors calls
   transient window where user can select 4 or 8 color mode.
   System default on modern desktop is 8.

   What is most important new feature in Color Style Manager are
   integration options. This are:

     * Own currently used backdrop synchronization (default)
     * X resources in $FVWM_USERDIR/Xdefaults (default)
     * GTK2 (default)
     * GTK3 (default)
     * Qt4 (default)
     * Qt5 (default)
     * Qt5 Kvatnum (not yet default, alternative to Qt5 gtk2
       engine)
     * User's $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local script if
       exists, called with the path of the applied palette and
       number of colors.

   The last integration is used to integrate what default widget
   integrations cannot reach. For example Gkrellm skin or some
   terminal preferences. Qt/Qt5 integration is easy, since this
   toolkits can use their GTK engine to integrate self with GTK
   theme. All that Color Style Manager has to do is to define GTK
   engine in ~/.config/Trolltech.conf and
   ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf for colors from the new palette to
   be used.

   Since NsCDE 2.1, Qt5 (but not Qt4) can use Kvantum based engine
   for integration with the rest of NsCDE and other widgets. This
   can be selected in Color Style Manager as an alternative to
   gtk2 bridge engine. It has somewhat finer tuned and polished
   look, however it has also still some problems in QDialog based
   widgets when scrollbars are used there.

   GTK2 and GTK3 are heavy work part. Here, we are using work
   derived from one CDE theme for XFCE desktop and GTK2 + GTK3,
   purified and adapted for NsCDE (see Section 24). This is
   written in python. If turned on, this will produce
   $HOME/.themes/NsCDE directory with the theme for GTK2 and GTK3,
   and will edit $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0 and
   $HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini to put or change
   gtk-theme-name value. If NsCDE palette with dark background 4
   color is choosen, Color Style Manager will put
   gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme into $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0 and
   $HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini. If palette with light color
   4 (used for text areas and text fields usually) is choosen,
   that variable will be removed from the both configuration
   files. When switching off from NsCDE to some other environment,
   care must be taken manually to handle
   gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme in configuration files if
   last palette in NsCDE was using dark background.

   If nscde_use_xsettingsd is set to 1 in the
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf after applying new color theme, user's
   X Settings in $FVWM_USERDIR/Xsettingsd.conf will be adjusted
   and xsettingsd(1) daemon restarted for settings in GTK and Qt
   applications to be applied immediately. This option can be
   enabled by editing NsCDE.conf or during initial setup. NsCDE
   starts xsettingsd daemon with "-c
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Xsettingsd.conf" parameter. This file must be
   present if it was not installed by the initial setup procedure.

   Key Bindings:

     * Ctrl+Return: Perform a change. Like if OK was pressed.
     * Ctrl+Q: Quits Color Style Manager.
     * P: Like Preview was pressed. Previews currently selected
       color scheme from the list
     * C: Loads Number of Colors dialog
     * M: Loads Modify Color dialog as if Modify was pressed
     * Up/Down: Goes one item on the color schemes list up or
       down.
     * Sun Help and F1: Displays this help text.

   Notice: In the preview mode under FVWM3 non-global monitor
   layout, only the backdrop of the currently focused monitor is
   previewed in the colors of the new palette.
     __________________________________________________________

5.5.1. Number Of Colors Dialog

   A Color Style Manager part

   Helper dialog to select 4, 8 or default color scheme in Color
   Style Manager. It changes number of colors while browsing,
   previewing or choosing a color theme, as well as two additional
   options for 8 colors scheme.

     * Use 4 Colors Scheme: Uses only the first four colors of the
       choosen palette. With slightly modified palette "Crimson"
       this was probably default on all versions of Sun Solaris.
     * Use 8 Colors Scheme: uses full palette with all 8 colors.
       This is NsCDE default on all modern displays.
     * Default (4|8): Indicates default which can be changed or
       turned back.
     * Color 8 for Front Panel and Icons: in 8 colors scheme, this
       will make icon part of the Front Panel and workspace icons
       background to use eighth color from the choosen palette
       instead of fifth color. This scheme was known to have been
       default on some HP-UX and AIX versions of CDE, and in NsCDE
       it is a user option. This option does not have effect in 4
       colors scheme, and hence cannot be selected together with
       it.
     * Color 6 for Workspace Manager: in 8 colors scheme, this
       will make Workspace Manager colored with color 6 which is
       usually used for menus, and tools background. This scheme
       was default on some versions of CDE on some UNIX systems,
       but in NsCDE it is a user option. This option does not have
       effect in 4 colors scheme, and hence cannot be selected
       together with it.

   Figure 32. Color Style Manager: Number of Colors

   [fig_color_ncolors_stylemgr.png]

   Key Bindings:

     * Ctrl+Return: Selects OK.
     * Escape: Quits Dialog.
     * Sun Help and F1: Displays this help text.
     __________________________________________________________

5.6. Exec Dialog

   By default key binding for Exec Dialog is Alt+F12, and an entry
   "Execute ..." located on main Workspace Menu above terminal
   item as "Exec" dialog. This is an input form for executing
   one-shot commands without terminal. It has options to run
   command in terminal ($[infostore.terminal]), and to remain open
   after executing commands for subsequent commands. It has it's
   own command history which can be turned back with cursor up and
   down keys. Escape key closes dialog, enter executes, Ctrl+Enter
   executes in default terminal application.

   Figure 33. Exec Dialog

   [fig_exec.png]

   As an example, this dialog can be used if on the current page
   or workspace terminal application is not present, and only some
   simple command is needed to be quickly executed.

   Key Bindings:

     * Escape: Quits Exec dialog
     * Return: Performs an action like if Exec is pressed.
     * Ctrl+Return: Performs an action like if Exec is pressed,
       and Execute in terminal checkbox is checked.
     * Shift+Return: Performs an action like if Exec is pressed,
       and Leave this dialog open checkbox is checked.
     * Ctrl+Shift+Return: Performs an action like if Exec is
       pressed, Execute in terminal and Leave this dialog open
       checkboxes are both checked.
     * Up/Down: Brings back and forth command history in text
       dialog box
     * Sun Help and F1: Displays this help text.

   If installed, NsCDE can use rofi(1) command and application
   launcher from the keybinding Alt+F12 instead of built in Exec
   Dialog. Workspace Menu item "Execute ..." remains the same,
   only keybinding will call rofi(1) instead of built-in simple
   Exec dialog. For this to work, InfoStore variable
   nscde_use_rofi must be set to "1" in the
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf. Rofi is integrated with NsCDE color
   theme and will be set up on the first use, which lasts 3
   seconds initially and after changing color theme with Color
   Style Manager.

   [fig_rofi.png]
     __________________________________________________________

5.7. Font Style Manager

   Font management is the area where NsCDE and CDE are probably
   most different. Font Style Manager is completely NsCDE tool to
   set fonts for usage inside FVWM and external toolkits
   integration (X Resources/Motif, GTK2, GTK3, Qt4, Qt5 ...).

   NsCDE defines 15 fonts. Five groups with three members:

     * Normal Small
     * Normal Medium
     * Normal Large
     * Bold Small
     * Bold Medium
     * Bold Large
     * Italic Small
     * Italic Medium
     * Italic Large
     * Monospaced Small
     * Monospaced Medium
     * Monospaced Large
     * Monospaced Bold Small
     * Monospaced Bold Medium
     * Monospaced Bold Large

   This fonts are defined as FVWM infostore variables in the file
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Font-$NSCDE_FONT_DPI.fvwmconf and/or in the
   file $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Font-$NCDE_FONT_DPI.fvwmgen. User's
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Font-$NSCDE_FONT_DPI.fvwmgen is a symlink
   to either $NSCDE_DATADIR/fontsets/SomeName.fontset or to
   $FVWM_USERDIR/fontsets/SomeName.fontset. Further, they are
   defined as CPP macros in $FVWM_USERDIR/Xdefaults.fontdefs which
   is included in $FVWM_USERDIR/Xdefaults where it is used. GTK2
   and GTK3 are also getting default font (Normal Medium) in their
   configurations if integration option has been selected in Font
   Style Manager. X resources and GTK are not refreshed by
   default, their checkboxes can be unselected if some of this
   widget integrations is not desirable by the user.

   Figure 35. Font Style Manager

   [fig_fontmgr.png]

   The Font Style Manager itself consists of fontsets and fonts.
   Fontsets are named complete sets of five groups of three
   members of fonts defined above. Fontsets are stored in
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/fontsets and in $FVWM_USERDIR/fontsets. If font
   set is selected in Font Style Manager, 15 fonts from the set
   are loaded into preview lists of the application and can be
   immediately applied or further customized by leaving Use
   Predefined Font Set mode before saving defined scheme as
   $FVWM_USERDIR/fontsets/SomeName.fontset and linking this name
   to $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE-Font-$NSCDE_FONT_DPI.fvwmgen. List of
   fontsets on the left GUI list is inactive until button Use
   Predefined Font Set is not turned on, then Font Style Manager
   operates with sets of fonts, and not in compose mode with
   individual fonts. In this mode, right GUI list contains
   information about fontset and previewed fonts when they are
   selected with mouse or keyboard. This information can contain
   additional bottom line (Not available) if font from the fontset
   does not exist under this name on the system. If such fontset
   is loaded and saved anyway, system's XFT subsystem will select
   nearest match or the default font instead of non-existing one.

   By default, manual font selection contains list of XFT fonts
   found on the system in the left GUI list and their styles
   (regular, bold, italic ...) on the right GUI list. list.

   DPI value for fonts in NsCDE is by default defined to be 96 in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Xdefaults.fontdefs as "Xft.dpi". This is to
   accomplish reasonable defaults for all widgets and programs
   which use them, but if overriden, existing user custom fontset
   for 96 DPI will not be considered anymore. System default from
   that approximate DPI range will be used until new custom
   fontset is created, where NSCDE_FONT_DPI will not be 96
   anymore.

   Main font selectors are:

     * Font Size Group
     * Font Style Group
     * Set Size (available only in manual selection mode)

   First popup menu loads 5 fonts from one of the 3 sets: small,
   medium or large. Second popup determines on which font current
   selection is working: normal, bold, italic, mono or mono bold
   (clicking on font preview itself has the same function) and
   third popup menu sets font size. When Font Style Manager is
   started, current fontset is loaded and previews are populated
   with that fonts. Default mode of operation will be switched to
   manual font selection for customizations into the new fontset.

   Button Default loads default
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/fontsets/DejaVuSerif.fontset which can then be
   saved as a choice or further customized into the new fontset.
   Bottom half of the Font Style Manager contains preview for all
   fonts from the one of the three selected size sets.

   Checkboxes Refresh GTK2/GTK3, and Refresh X Resources" are
   integrating font selection with popular widgets by providing
   normal medium font and it's size to their configuration files.
   Qt4 and Qt5 should automatically pick Gtk fonts if Qt "GTK2"
   font engine is active in their configurations. If not,
   qtconfig-qt4 and qt5ct applications can be started and some
   minor changes done and undone - enough for Apply/Save to take
   effect, and then font from Gtk will be loaded for sure.
   Checkbox Run User Script will attempt to run
   $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/fontmgr.local if it exists, with argument
   of the new config file. This is intended for user's
   customizations which are currently beyond NsCDE's scope of
   program and widget integrations.

   Save button will save fontset choice, or generated selection as
   a new fontset in manual selection mode, make link to it in
   $FVWM_USERDIR. If manual modification has taken place, user
   will be asked to name a new fontset with the popup dialog. Name
   "custom" is the default proposal in the dialog, but it should
   be changed, because this name is predestinated to be rewritten
   on the next Font Style Manager saving action. Further, user
   will be asked to immediately restart FVWM, for changes to be
   applied from all parts from the new configuration.

   Key Bindings:

     * Ctrl+Return: Perform a change. Like if OK was pressed.
     * Ctrl+Q: Quits Font Style Manager.
     * Sun Help and F1: Displays this help text.
     * Up (Arrow Up): Selects prior font or fontset on the list
     * Down (Arrow Down): Selects next font or fontset on the list
     * Prior (Page Up): Selects preview box from the bottom to the
       top and cycles back to the bottom again
     * Next (Page Down): Selects preview box from the top to the
       botttom and cycles back to the top again
     * Ctrl+S: Loads small group of fonts on the preview fileds
     * Ctrl+M: Loads medium group of fonts on the preview fileds
     * Ctrl+L: Loads large group of fonts on the preview fileds
     * Ctrl+Plus: In manual selection mode, increases font size
       for selected font
     * Ctrl+Minus: In manual selection mode, decreases font size
       for selected font
     * Ctrl+Equal: Sets font size to default start point size for
       current font size group previewed
     * Ctrl+F: Changes mode of operation between prefedined
       fontsets and manual font selection mode
     __________________________________________________________

5.8. Keyboard Style Manager

   Keyboard Style Manager tool can be used to set four xset(1)
   values, and to change default Key Binding Set.

     * Auto Repeat on/off: Sets characters to repeat when you hold
       down their keys
     * Start Delay (start of repeat delay): initial delay on
       pressed key to start with auto repetition
     * Repeat Delay: Speed at which auto repeat works
     * Click Volume: Determines the volume of key clicks (turned
       off at 0%)

   This values are standard xset(1) r and c subcommands and their
   values, minimal and maximal allowed values are (or should be in
   most cases) the same in GUI as they are in command line tool.

   Pop down menu "Key Binding Set" lets user choose between "cua"
   and "nscde1x" key binding implementations. See Common User
   Access (CUA) Key Bindings and NsCDE 1.X Key Bindings. Changing
   this setting and applying changes will restart FVWM window
   manager.

   Default button will set auto repeat to on, start rate to 512,
   repeat delay to 16 and click volume to 50. Set of key bindings
   will be set to "cua".

   Apply button applies setting in runtime, while Save button
   writes $FVWM_USERDIR/Xset.conf file which is a generated xset
   command batch executed during startup.

5.9. Occupy Workspace, Occupy Page and Occupy Monitor

   This tool dialog is called from the left titlebar button 1
   Window Operations Menu as "Occupy Workspace", "Occupy Page" or
   "Occupy Monitor". Or from Meta+Space key for Workspace,
   Alt+Space for Page, and Meta+Alt+Space key combinations from
   the window context. Occupy tool is the extended (for FVWM pages
   and multiple monitors) version of the same CDE dialog and it
   sends selected window to a workspace, page or XRandR monitor
   selected from the list, or it can make it sticky across
   workspaces and/or pages with All Workspaces or All Pages
   checkbox pressed in. One addition here is the checkbox Go With
   the Window; when checked, makes NsCDE to change a current
   workspace, page and/or monitor and go with the window, or where
   window was sent. Radio buttons Workspaces:, Pages: and
   Monitors: are changing the current context of operation between
   workspaces, pages and monitors, which is visually also
   manifested in the main list as the names of either workspaces,
   pages or RandR names of the monitors. If called as "Occupy
   Workspace", pages or monitors can also be selected and changed
   by switching this context with this buttons or with the Space
   key shortcut in focused Occupy window. Radio button for
   monitors and "Occupy Monitor" functionality is only shown and
   available if multiple physical (or virtual) monitors are
   detected by FVWM and NsCDE. OK performs an action, Dismiss
   quits Occupy tool without taking action.

   Figure 37. Occupy Workspace, Page or Monitor

   [fig_occupy_workspace.png]

   On the upper left part of the window there are three buttons
   with labels Workspaces, Pages and Monitors:. When either one or
   another selection is changed from the current state, that is,
   state of the workspace and page on which window context was
   when Occupy is called, there will appear an ASCII asterisk (*)
   symbol at the end of the label. This means selection is
   changed, and this is visible for workspaces or monitors even
   when pages are on the selection list and/or vice versa. If
   selection is changed back again to state of page, workspace
   and/or monitor, which was initial, asterisk will disappear, but
   will again appear when this selection is changed to some other
   choice again. That way, orientation of what was touched can be
   known.

   Key Bindings:

     * Escape: Quits Occupy Tool without performing an action.
     * H, Sun Help and F1: Displays this help text, like Help was
       pressed.
     * A: Checks All Workspaces or if context is pages, All Pages
       checkbox.
     * Return: Performs move action like OK button was pressed,
       without going to the selected workspace and/or page.
     * Ctrl+Return: Performs move action like OK button was
       pressed, and changes active workspace and/or page to the
       same destination where window has been sent.
     * Up/Down: Selects workspace, page or monitor in the up or
       down direction on the list.
     * Space: Changes between workspaces, pages and monitors mode
       of operation. Actions on workspaces, pages and monitors can
       be combined while switching modes of operation, no matter
       if it was initially called as "Occupy Workspace", "Occupy
       Page" or "Occupy Monitor".
     __________________________________________________________

5.10. Graphical Workspace Manager (GWM)

   Same named graphical tool was historically present usually on
   Sun Solaris. Graphical Workspace Manager of NsCDE is FvwmPager
   and FvwmScript based version of GWM. It implements most of the
   functions of CDE GWM which are applicable in NsCDE and FVWM
   environment. It also implements some NsCDE and FVWM specific
   options.

   Figure 38. Graphical Workspace Manager - GWM

   [fig_gwm.png]

   This tool can be called from Root Menu, from
   Applications->NsCDE submenu of the Workspace Menu,
   Meta+Alt+Home keybindings, and by default from the 7th Subpanel
   of the Front Panel (Desktop Settings).

   GWM enables user to see all of the NsCDE workspaces and pages,
   navigate pages and workspaces with mouse, select windows with
   middle mouse button, and taking actions on them with Window
   menu actions.

   With actions on the Workspaces menu, it is possible to:

     * Call Workspaces and Pages Style Manager

5.10.1. Graphical Workspace Manager Options

   GWM Options dialog can configure some aspects of the GWM itself
   and GWM pager behaviour. By configuring the later, a stripped
   down version "GlobalPager" is also configured.

   The following controls can be configured:

     * Show Workspace Backdrops - if unselected, only a CDE
       palette colors associated to this workspace will be drawin
       in the workspace pager background. Default is selected.
     * Highlight Current Workspace Page - current workspace
       background will be colored in active window color. By
       default this option is off, it is however used by
       LocalPager.
     * Workspace Names Above Workspaces - workspace names are
       drawn as headers of the workspaces. Default.
     * Workspace Names Below Workspaces - workspace names are
       drawn as footers of the workspaces. Not default.
     * Number Of Visible Rows - when this number is smaller,
       workspaces are firstly drawn horizontally, then vertically.
       If this number is 1, workspaces are all in one row. Biggest
       number possible with current number of workspaces used will
       produce vertical GWM application with all workspaces in one
       column.
     * Desired Workspace Width (Ratio) - number between 10 and 20.
       By default a calculation is done to show bigger GWM on
       higher screen resolutions and more compact smaller on lower
       screen resolutions. If this number is too big, and in
       combination with one-row or one-column setup with 4 or more
       workspaces on lower resolutions can produce wider window
       that cannot fit on the screen. Experimenting is enocouraged
       however.
     * Show Window Names In Balloons - weather to show small
       marker balloons on mouse over windows action in the pager.
       Default is on.
     * Respect Window Skip List - do not draw in the pager windows
       which are part of the FVWM skiplist (like Front Panel,
       Gkrellm, transients etc ...)
     * Show Small Icons Inside Windows - if selected (the default)
       it will draw mini icons of applications present on the
       workspaces.
     * Show Names Inside Windows: icon names of the windows will
       be written in pager windows frames with very small font
       instead of mini icons. Not default.

5.11. Window Geometry Manager

   This tool dialog is called from the left titlebar button menu.
   Or from Meta+Alt+G key combination from the window context.
   This Manager offers convenience to save size and position of
   the non-transient window. Once window geometry is saved, next
   run of the same application window on FVWM page where the
   window of the same resource+class combination is not already
   present will cause window to be resized to that exact width,
   height, X position and Y position X11 coordinates as stored in
   the $FVWM_USERDIR/GeoDB.ini. This ini-style file is managed by
   this application, as well as from the background runner
   $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/confset and read by the
   $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/confget. Application automatically fills X11
   Class and X11 Resource names on contextual call, as well as
   geometry parameters. Before applying this settings, user has a
   chance to fine tune this parameters in text fields and confirm
   (or cancel) the action on the end. Using Clear all geometry
   values, as well as those which may be saved from the past are
   cleared and deleted. After the Clear action, there are two
   options:

     * Filling all fields manually and saving the result
     * Saving empty fields: this action will cancel and/or remove
       any existing geometry mappings for the selected X11 program
       window.

   Note that geometry savings are dependent on the current monitor
   resolution. In other words, size and position of the X11 window
   are saved for 1920x1080, 2560x1440, 1600x900 and any other
   possible monitor resolution. Multiple savings on different
   monitor resolutions are possible and saved under separate
   sections in $FVWM_USERDIR/GeoDB.ini.

5.12. Mouse Style Manager

   Mouse Style Manager tool manages pointer - that is, mouse
   settings. It's duties are few more than only xset(1) m command.
   Namely:

     * Mouse acceleration (xset)
     * Threshold (xset)
     * Double-Click
     * Handedness (xmodmap)

   Acceleration and Threshold are standard xset(1) m options and
   man page for xset(1) should be consulted.

   Handedness can be set to flip left and right mouse button
   functions, while Double Click is in fact most complex: it has
   test area where user can test double click speed (pixmap will
   change on double-click success), and this setting is changing:

     * FVWM MenuStyle DoubleClick value ($FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf)
     * X Resources multiClickTime resource in
       $FVWM_USERDIR/Xdefaults.mouse
     * Qt/KDE settings in $HOME/.kde/share/config/kdeglobals (or
       similar path) if found
     * Gtk2 ($HOME/.gtkrc-2.0) if file exists
     * Gtk3 ($HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini) if file exists

   Double-Click value is in milliseconds in all mentioned
   configurations. Apply button applies xset and xmodmap values
   set in runtime, but not double-click settings.

   Save button saves changes in $FVWM_USERDIR/Xset.conf and all
   other optional files for widget and FVWM integration. Default
   button will set handedness for right-handed, double-click on
   450, acceleration on 60, and threshold on 8, apply xset and
   xmodmap values, FVWM MenuStyle DoubleClickTime and will warp
   pointer to Save button for actions to be written in config
   files.

5.13. Power Save Manager

   This tool manages screen DPMS values. It uses standard xset(1)
   to set screen standby, suspend and off times. Values are from 0
   to 65535. Standby time cannot be bigger than suspend and/or off
   time, and suspend time cannot be bigger than off time.

   It has a checkbox which enables or disables DPMS management at
   all. Values are written in $FVWM_USERDIR/Xset.conf.

   If $HOME/.xscreensaver is present and has DPMS options in it,
   they will be synchronized with xset dpms options written in
   Xset.conf. Apply button applies runtime (but not xscreensaver)
   while Save button writes configuration file and
   $HOME/.xscreensaver DPMS settings if this file exists. Default
   button will set the following defaults: DPMS on, standby 1200
   seconds, suspend 1800 seconds, and off time 2400 seconds, apply
   this settings on runtime, and point mouse to Save button for
   changes to be written.

5.14. Subpanel Manager

   Only in NsCDE. Tool written for managing FvwmButtons transient
   Subpanels which are opened from the Front Panel. It is called
   from Install Icon action on every Subpanel. This tool exists
   because FvwmButtons doesn't implement drag and drop, and there
   is no application manager present, since this part of CDE
   functions cannot be easy implemented even if some file manager
   is taken to act as application manager.

   Figure 43. Subpanel Manager

   [fig_subpanelmgr.png]

   Subpanel Manager has a list of all applications which are
   providing system menu with it's presence (fvwm-menu-desktop is
   used in the background for generating application list), and
   the list of applications provided in the current Subpanel from
   which tool is called by "Install Icon". This lists are
   displayed on the top of the window side by side: system menu
   applications on the left, and current Subpanel items on the
   right list. There are 3 text fields: Name, Command and Icon
   File. This fields are automatically populated when some item
   from mentioned lists is clicked, but it can also be populated
   manually if user wishes to add a custom application, Fvwm
   Module, Fvwm Function or other entry manually on the Subpanel.
   For manually adding application entry to subpanel, initially at
   least one item from the list of available applications must be
   initially selected, and then totally or partially rewritten and
   overriden, otherwise, no item will be added to the subpanel.
   Special type of "Check for ..." is meant for entries which in
   command field are defining for the first command something
   common like shell, env etc. If we want to override a pointless
   check existance for this, and define other command string for
   checking, popdown menu option Check for ... can be selected,
   and small text field below popdown menu will appear, where this
   command can be specified. Subpanel Manager can also remove
   existing entries from the Subpanel.

   Subpanel Manager implements this helper functions for modifying
   and applying settings on new items:

     * Type (exec, module, function, other, check-for)
     * Do not check for command existence
     * Icon indicator

   To place some new application from the left (all applications)
   list in exact place on the subpanel, select an existing entry
   on the subpanel (right) list. When left arrow button is
   clicked, new application will appear on the list exactly below
   that one which has been previously selected, otherwise, default
   is to place new entries as second entry on the subpanel's list
   of applications.

   Click on the icon indicator will open simple file browser which
   can be used to find, see as preview, and set icon for manual
   entries which are not part of the applications list, or an
   alternative icon for program from applications list. Apply
   button regenerates subpanel, while Save button does this and
   also quits Subpanel Manager.

   Figure 44. Configured Subpanel

   [fig_subpanel.png]

   Subpanels configuration file Subpanels.actions, can be edited
   by hand in $FVWM_USERDIR if something needs to be changed on
   existing entries. If editing by hand,
   $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/generate_subpanels must be used to generate
   FVWM configuration output which must be redirected into
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Subpanels.fvwmX.fvwmconf, where "fvwmX" is either
   "fvwm2" or "fvwm3".

   Key Bindings:

     * Ctrl+Return: Perform a change. Like if OK was pressed.
     * Alt+Return: Apply a change, but do not save it permanently.

5.15. Subpanel Settings

   A small helper dialog with functions to change display name of
   the subpanel, width of the subpanel if titles require wider (or
   short ones narrower) panel frame, end enabled/disabled state of
   the subpanel. Button Reset will erase user configuration and
   load system default one for given subpanel. Name, width and
   enablement all have their own Default button right of the text
   field. If pressed, it will load system defaults for name, width
   and subpanel's enablement state. All buttons are doing in
   memory changes until OK is pressed, except Reset button which
   acts immediately. Close button closes dialog without changes
   except if Reset has been pressed. This dialog is called from
   subpanel menu which can be popped with the left (and only)
   button on subpanel's titlebar. It is called Subpanel Settings.
   It reloads configuration of the given subpanel after applying
   changes and exiting with OK.

   [fig_FpIconMgr1.png]

   Front Panel Icon Manager can set icon and command of the empty
   Front Panel Button, or change it's icon and content if selected
   from the Front Panel button contextual menu with the mouse
   button 3 as Change This Button. Front Panel Icon Manager edits
   user's $FVWM_USERDIR/FrontPanel.actions.

   Front Panel Icon Manager has a list of system recognized
   desktop applications, and text fields with their names,
   commands and icon paths. Icon for every entry is also displayed
   if it exists. If the icon does not exist, or user wants to
   change it, clicking an icon will run file picker, which can be
   used to select alternative icon of choice. Icon should not be
   bigger than 48x48 pixels, which is default size for Front Panel
   icons, it can be less, but it will not looks nice in that case.
   Fileds with name and command can be also edited before applying
   new settings to the button. Name of the action is visible on
   the contextual menu called with mouse button 3 on the Front
   Panel's icon.

5.17. System Action Dialog

   This is the login/logout form with the possibilities to reboot
   or shutdown the system, or change X session. It has also
   options for suspend/sleep (S3), hybrid suspend, and hibernation
   of the system. Of course, reboot, shutdown, suspend, hybrid
   suspend and hibernate will work for a ordinary user only if
   system is configured with authorizations for a user to perform
   such actions. Examples of this can be systemd(1) on Linux which
   recognizes local user, or system with sudo(8) entries are
   configured to do so. While System Action Dialog is active, root
   cursor changes to line-crossed cursor which is dismissed after
   the action is performed or dialog action dismissed. Not all of
   this actions are possible on all systems, but with the
   $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/acpimgr wrapper, Linux with pm-utils, Linux
   without pm-utils but with systemd(1) and FreeBSD with
   acpiconf(8) are supported in this moment.

   any functions apart close (Dismiss) button. It's role is
   informational. It displays current username, hostname, machine
   and CPU architecture type. IP address, hostid, network (NIS,
   NISPLUS, LDAP ...) domain name, internet domain name, size of
   the physical RAM, swap size, swap usage (as progressbar),
   operating system long name, and then version of the FVWM and
   version of the NsCDE. Last, it shows time when system was last
   booted. This dialog can be found on the Tools or fourth
   Subpanel of the Front Panel in default configuration, under the
   entry Workstation Info. In the context of it's window, keys
   Escape, Return and Q will close a window, while Sun Help and F1
   displays this documentation.
     __________________________________________________________

5.19. Window Style Manager

   This GUI tool is not just exact copy of the similary named CDE
   tool Window Style Manager. NsCDE Window Style Manager extends
   number of actions which can be configured regarding window
   behaviour, which is undestandible because FVWM window manager
   is a way more configurable and powerful than CDE's original
   dtwm.

   On the other hand, writing a tool that will handle ALL fvwm
   options and write that in FvwmScript which not much a powerful
   language can easily contain tens of thousands lines of code,
   and yet be buggy and probably some things will be impossible to
   do. Even then, it will be burden for users to use and almost
   completely avoided.

   A middle solution was provided: all functions from original CDE
   dialog, plus some similar extended FVWM options, on the first
   tab, and other important configurations on the rest three tabs.
   Tabs are implemented as popup menu on the top right side of the
   window - choosing an option from that menu changes displayed
   options - a poor man's tabs in a way. Some of options provided
   by Window Style Manager are not full set of this options if
   configured manually in FVWM configuration, but for needs of CDE
   clone this is more than enough.
     __________________________________________________________

5.19.1. Configuration Section: Window Behavior

   Figure 50. Window Style Manager: Window and Window Icons tabs

   [fig_windowmgr1.png]

     * Only Pointer Inside Window Makes Focus: this configures so
       called MouseFocus as catch-all FVWM Style (*). See fvwm(1)
       for MouseFocus.
     * Point In Window To Make Active: this is FVWM SloppyFocus
       Style option. This is default focus style. If you want more
       CDE behavior, select MouseFocus option above. In
       SloppyFocus mode, pointer will make focus on window while
       entering it, but will not lose focus while leaving the
       window. See fvwm(1) for SloppyFocus.
     * Click In Window To Make Active: self-explanatory. This is
       FVWM's ClickToFocus style.
     * Raise Window When Made Active: self explanatory. If
       selected, focused window will be raised. This option will
       enable FvwmAuto module instance with -mfocus option. See
       fvwm(1) and FvwmAuto(1).
     * Allow Primary Windows On Top: this will allow window to
       lower it's transient windows (popups and such). See fvwm(1)
       for RaiseTransient and DontRaiseTransient styles.
     * Lower Transient With Primary Window: self explanatory. See
       fvwm(1) for LowerTransient and DontLowerTransient
     * Raise/Lower Primaries With Transients: if transient windows
       are raised or lowered, primary windows goes with them. See
       fvwm(1) for StackTransientParent and
       DontStackTransientParent style options.
     * Show Contents During Move: weather window contents is
       visible or not during window move. Default is a transparent
       frame with a grid. See fvwm(1) for OpaqueMoveSize.
     * Time After Which Active Window Is Raised: if Raise Window
       When Made Active is turned on, this option will be enabled
       and time in milliseconds can be set here. See FvwmAuto(1).
     * Manual Window Movement Threshold: see fvwm(1) for a
       MoveThreshold option. 5 pixels is the default.
     __________________________________________________________

5.19.2. Configuration Section: Window Icons

     * Use Icon Box: if this option is selected, main FVWM
       configuration in Main.fvwmconf will spawn FvwmIconBox
       configured as close as possible as an alternative to icons
       of iconified windows. Classic icons will be disabled. The
       rest of options in this "tab" will be disabled because they
       do not apply anymore in this configuration. Note:
       FvwmIconBox has not exactly the same functionality as CDE's
       Icon Box.
     * Place On Workspace: default. Icons of the windows will be
       placed on the screen. By default, from top left to the
       direction bottom left.
     * Place Icons Left/Right from Bottom/Top to Top/Bottom: this
       four exclusive options will direct icon placement on the
       screen. See IconBox and IconFill options in fvwm(1) for
       more information.
     * Default Icon Size: in pixels. See IconSize in fvwm(1).
     * Maximum Icon Size: in pixels. See IconSIze in fvwm(1).
     __________________________________________________________

5.19.3. Configuration Section: Page Edges

   Figure 51. Window Style Manager: Page Edges and Animation tabs

   [fig_windowmgr2.png]

     * Raise Front Panel On Page Change: as is says, when current
       active page changes, Front Panel will be raised.
     * Pager Preview On Page Change: on page change, spawn a small
       transient FVWM pager called LocalPager on the top center of
       the screen to indicate what is on the current page in the
       workspace - this is controlled by the FVWM infostore
       variable pageshowrootpager in the $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf
     * Disable Page Change On Screen Edge: if selected, current
       page will not change when pointer is longer time on the
       screen edge. In this mode, active page must be changed by
       other means (keyboard shortcuts, WSM submenus, PGM, left
       click on 1st titlebar button ...)
     * Page Change On Screen Edge (1px): default internal detector
       of the screen edge. Do not change this if it is working.
     * Page Change On Screen Edge (2px) If FVWM has a problem with
       X server and page change does not work smooth, use this
       option as a safe alternative. See fvwm(1).
     * Page Edge Resistance: how many milliseconds FVWM waits on
       the screen edge area for an page change action to be taken.
       Default is 380.
     * Edge Window Move Resistance: similar as Page Edge
       Resistance, but for move operation - how hard it should be
       to move a window between pages. Defaults to 80 pixels.
     * Edge Window Move Delay: time to wait to consider moved
       window for page change in the first place (to start
       counting pixels of the Edge Window Move Resistance).
       Defaults to 320 pixels.
     __________________________________________________________

5.19.4. Configuration Section: Animation

   This tab controls behavior of the FvwmAnimate. See
   FvwmAnimate(1).

     * Animate Window Iconification: on/off of the FvwmAnimate
       module.
     * Animation Effect: See FvwmAnimate(1)
     * Animation Frame Delay: See FvwmAnimate(1)
     * Animation Revolution Twist: See FvwmAnimate(1)
     * Outline Width: See FvwmAnimate(1)
     * Animation Iterations: See FvwmAnimate(1), be careful on
       virtual displays with a bad video driver. It can behave
       really slower than on host system with the same parameters.
     __________________________________________________________

5.19.5. Misc Window Style Manager Functions

   Button Default on the top right edge of the window will read
   system defaults into options and they will be set in permanent
   configuration if OK button is pressed afterwards.

   OK button applies changes to $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf. Dismiss
   button will close the window without making any changes.

5.20. Workspaces and Pages Style Manager (WsPgMgr)

   This tool is specific to NsCDE. It configures the following
   things:

     * Number of the workspaces
     * Names of the workspaces
     * Number of virtual pages in the workspaces
     * Use / Do not use compact Workspace Manager on the Front
       Panel
     * Desktop Model on multi head monitor setup (FVWM3 only)

   Figure 52. Workspaces and Pages Manager

   [fig_wspgmgr.png]

   This graphical tool writes files $FVWM_USERDIR/WSM.conf and
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf. On the top of the window is a
   graphical representation of the Workspace Manager. When
   clicked, every button becomes editable field and it's name can
   be changed (pres return on the text field after writing new
   name). This change will be written immediately WITHOUT pressing
   OK button. Name of the workspace will be changed across all
   NsCDE and FVWM (WSM, Occupy Workspace/Page/Monitor, menus etc).
   In NsCDE, there are 5 options for workspaces: 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8
   model. FVWM itself however supports much larger number, but in
   NsCDE care must be taken about presentation of this workspaces
   in various applets and tools. Nevertheless, theoretically even
   in NsCDE with maximum number of workspaces multiplied with
   maximum number of pages, user can get 128 working screens which
   is probably enough (too much) for 99% of the people.

   Check Box Use Compact Workspace Manager when checked in will
   instruct NsCDE to use Workspace Manager widget in the Front
   Panel sized for as it is for four workspaces, but it will
   expand buttons in two workspaces setup and shrink accordingly
   in the case of six or eight workspaces setup. This option does
   not have any visual effect on four workspaces setups, because
   it is sized for such setup.

   Number of vertical and horizontal pages can also be configured
   here. This change will affect Page Manager (PGM) icon on the
   Front Panel, and menus which are displaying pages. Page names
   are not configurable via GUI, their names are read from
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/pages/, but can be overriden in user's
   configuration. User can put into it's $FVWM_USERDIR/WSM.conf
   enties in the same format as files in the above mentioned
   directory.

   Pop up menu prefixed as "Monitor Workspaces" allows users of
   NsCDE with FVWM3 to select between currently existing three
   modes of FVWM3 desktop configurations: global, per-monitor or
   shared. When used with FVWM2, this popup will not be shown,
   instead, text "Global Only (FVWM2)" will indicate
   non-applicability of this feature under FVWM2. Under FVWM3, new
   DesktopConfiguation model is used immediately, but FVWM3 is
   still restarted to get consistent and clear new behaviour of
   the window manager.

   OK button saves configuration, restarts window manager and
   quits. Cancel button discards, except if new names of desks are
   set, because this is written immediately, but window manager is
   not restarted. Workspaces and Pages Style Manager is called
   from the Style Manager, NsCDE submenu of the Workspace Menu's
   Applications submenu, and Front Panel's small left button menu
   which is called when that button is clicked with the right
   pointer button.

   Key Bindings:

     * Return: Rename currently selected workspace.
     * Escape: Leave workspace button without modifying it's name.
     * Ctrl+Return: Perform a change. Like if OK was pressed.
     * Escape: Quits Workspaces and Pages Manager if dialog is not
       in the workspace rename process.
     * Ctrl+Q: Quits Workspaces and Pages Manager.
     * Sun Help and F1: Displays this documentation page.

5.21. NsCDE Process Manager (NProcMgr)

   This tool is specific to NsCDE. It manages NsCDE FVWM and rest
   NsCDE processes, and re-reads given part of the FVWM
   configuration on demand. The following actions are provided and
   supported:

     * Recheck - Check selected item processes running state
     * Restart - Restarts selected item processes
     * Stop - Stops selected item processes
     * Start - Starts selected item processes
     * Reread - Reads fresh FVWM configuration for the item
       selected on the Configurations popup menu.

   There can be more processes (items) selected for a given
   action. Items are not unselected after action. NsCDE Process
   Manager can be used for diagnostic, debugging and developing
   functions and other parts of the NsCDE. It Provides GUI for
   "KillModule", "Module" and various NsCDE FVWM functions, and
   for f_ReadCfg". Process list consists of check buttons with
   item/process names on the left, and their functional state,
   running state and PID on the right side. After every action,
   selected item is checked again and it's running state and PID
   are refreshed. Check All Now button when pressed will refresh
   status for all items, selected or not.

6. Helper Dialogs

6.1. ActionForm - FvwmScript

   Figure 54. Action Form

   [fig_action_form.png]

   Dialog which uses custom text and asks user for action. Action
   is then executed (OK) or aborted (Dismiss). Example of usage is
   restart dialog. Application must provide in argument vector
   question text, title text, buttons text, and buttons actions
   when calling this dialog.
     __________________________________________________________

6.2. ChoiceForm - FvwmScript

   Similar as ActionForm, but button actions are not provided in
   command line, but signal about chosen action is sent to the
   calling program ("father" FvwmScript usually). Used only in
   Font Style Manager for now.
     __________________________________________________________

6.3. FilePicker - FvwmScript

   Figure 55. File Picker

   [fig_file_picker.png]

   A simple file pick open/save dialog. Copy of FVWM file picker,
   but with added option to display a file if file is an icon. It
   is a simple file browser with up and home shortcuts, path view
   and show/hide button for hidden (files starting with a dot)
   files.

   Used in Backdrop Style Manager, Subpanel Manager, and Color
   Style Manager for adding backdrops, photos, icons and palettes.
     __________________________________________________________

6.4. InputForm - FvwmScript

   Figure 56. Input Form

   [fig_input_form.png]

   Form with text field which asks user to name something. If OK
   is pressed, string is sent to the parent script for further
   processing. Used in Font Style Manager.
     __________________________________________________________

6.5. WaitNotice - FvwmScript

   Short lived simple FvwmScript form, butonless and with a 3
   slots for text. This dialog serves as short information if some
   NsCDE action is started which is not immediately obvious in a
   1-2 seconds. It will appear in the middle of the screen with a
   bigger font and relief text and live between half of the second
   till 5 seconds. Depending with which text and duration time it
   was called by some function or other FvwmScript program. If
   clicked or receives return or escape key, it will dissapear
   immediately.

   Figure 57. Wait Notice

   [fig_wait_notice.png]

   Used by Color Style Manager, SysActionDialog and a documetation
   view function f_DisplayURL.
     __________________________________________________________

6.6. Splash - FvwmScript

   Figure 58. NsCDE Splash Screen

   [fig_splash.png]

   Splash screen is started at the beggining of the NsCDE session.
   It covers all the screen(s) and displays NsCDE logo in upper
   left corner, and on the lower left corner there is a info about
   system on which NsCDE is running, FVWM version used, licence,
   and startup message. Pressing Ctrl+C or clicking at the text
   exits Splash screen before it's timeout, which is 7-8 seconds.
   Splash is wrapped in the f_Splash function and can be called
   interactively during existing session by calling this function.

7. Backdrops, Palettes and Fonts

   Together with Workspace Manager, Backdrops and Palettes are
   probably most recognizable aspects of CDE, by which CDE is
   visually distinguished from other desktop environments.

   CDE backdrops, are relatively simple XPM textures and pictures
   consisting usualy from 2-5 base colors: background, foreground,
   selectColor, topShadowColor, and bottomShadowColor. This colors
   are taken from the current (or custom) palette and applied to
   the symbolic definition of colors in XPM templates. Backdrop is
   then generated, tiled and applied to the root window. Every
   workspace can have it's own backdrop texture. In 4 colors mode
   of the palette theme, they are all colored in the same pattern,
   while in 8 colors mode, every workspace from 1-4 has it's own
   color variant from the current palette, in that case,
   workspaces from 5 to 8 are repeating colors from 1 to 4. In
   other words, if there are more that four desks defined, color
   of the fifth workspace is repeated color of the first, sixth of
   the second and so on.

   Here, in addition to original CDE textures, there are some 100
   new and custom textures created from (free and public) textures
   which were convenient for this customization. In other words,
   NsCDE implements more than 100 backdrops, and with Backdrop
   Style Manager user can import to it's $FVWM_USERDIR/backdrops
   it's own backdrops, or put them there with terminal or file
   manager.

   Backdrops must have alternative extension for X Pixmaps: that
   is, not .xpm, but .pm.

   If one wants their custom backdrop to be dynamic with
   palette/theme of NsCDE, one must edit them to set symbolic
   names of the colors described above. Examining existing
   backdrops is the fastest way to get idea what needs to be done.
   Apart from symbolic names, backdrops also have a real color
   defined to be compatible with XPM specification, but values of
   this colors can be arbitrary, since they are not used if
   symbolic name on the same line is set. Usually, they are in
   gray spectrum.

   Default backdrops are set from the
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/backer until user does not redefine/set
   his own with Backdrop Style Manager. Default palette is Broica
   in 8 colors variant.

   Thematically generated backdrops generated by Backdrop Style
   manager are installed in user's
   $FVWM_USERDIR/backer/DeskN-<backdropname>.pm and defined in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Backdrops.fvwmgen as colorsets of TiledPixmap
   type. NsCDE reserved FVWM colorsets numbers for backdrops are
   from 31-38 for all eight possible workspaces.
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Backdrops.fvwmgen file is read by FvwmBacker(1)
   FVWM module. It is automatically generated when user makes
   first change with Backdrop Style Manager.

   Until then, system wide file
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Backdrops.fvwmconf applies, which itself
   reads pre-generated and pre-defined backdrops from the
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/backer directory. Default color theme
   is Broica.

   We can consider backdrops as the source form or template files,
   and when processed with color values from the palette, this
   backdrop's final form is, ready to be set by FvwmBacker(1).

   When NsCDE is used with FVWM3 and per-monitor or shared
   DekstopConfiguration monitor modes, FvwmBacker(1) is not in
   use, because it cannot treat different physical (and virtual)
   monitors separately. Functions driven by the new_desk
   FvwmEvent(1) event are called in that case, which will be
   loaded from the cache directory $FVWM_USERDIR/backer/bgcache if
   found, or automatically generated with the help of
   ImageMagick's convert(1) tool if they do not exist, and then
   loaded. This mechanism automatically calculates screen width,
   height, X and Y coordinates, desks and backdrops to produce
   cjoined backdrops as one big PNG file which is then loaded to
   show correct background for desks on different monitors.

8. Keyboard and Mouse Bindings

   This section describes what individual actions with keyboard
   and mouse on different elements od the windows and other parts
   of NsCDE are performing. Key and mouse bindings can be combined
   or keyboard-only or mouse-only actions. First two subsections
   of this section are describing two different sets of key
   bindings implemented in NsCDE, while the third one explains the
   actions performed by mouse alone, or in combination with some
   key modifiers. Key and Mouse bindings are extendable or can be
   overriden by user locally, as pretty much everything in NsCDE
   and FVWM. All this bindings are made to be ergonomically easy
   to use, remember and speed up everyday's work under NsCDE.
   Additionally, new "cua" key binding set implements IBM standard
   Common User Access rules which is used on almost all general
   purpose systems today, so the user may find it easier to adopt
   and more logical to map action to keys. Note that using
   keyboard or setup without modifier 4 defined will degrade key
   bindings usage, hence having a keyboard (or a X server software
   setup with xmodmap(1) is a must for extended key bindings usage
   of NsCDE. This goes generally for X11 environment, as well as
   for mouse with at least 3 buttons.

   Key and Mouse bindings can be applied globally, independent of
   context, or in the context of some screen element. This
   contexts are:

     * A - Any context
     * R - Root Window (Backdrop of the screen)
     * W - Application Window
     * F - Window Borders
     * S - Window Border Corners
     * T - Title Bar
     * I - Icon

   NsCDE is using 4 modifier keys in single and multi-modifier
   combinations with other keys to implement key bindings. This
   modifiers are:

     * Control
     * Shift
     * Meta (sometimes called Super) - Mod4
     * Alt

   In combinations with escape, function keys, tab, backspace,
   home, menu, letters, numbers and other keys, NsCDE builds rich
   set of keyboard shortcuts also called keybindings in the FVWM
   terminology.

   Keybindings can be partially or complitely overriden by the
   user's creation and writing of
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Keybindings.fvwmconf (override) or extended by
   adding custom key bindings into
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Keybindings.fvwmlocal (Redefinition of key also
   overrides here). Key bindings which are described with their
   Mod+Key items on some menus (like Window Operation Menu) can be
   extended or overwritten in $FVWM_USERDIR/Keymenu.actions. Care
   must be taken when composing custom key bindings not to
   override common application shortcuts or to make some keys,
   letters and numbers on the keyboard unusable in normal writing
   contexts. Examples of such shortcuts are Ctrl+Q which in 85%
   cases closes the application, or Alt+Shift which is often
   switching between keyboard layouts under the X server.

   Notice when there is a reference to the "Menu" key this means
   also "Compose" on some keyboards.

   If some unwanted or clashing keybindings needs to be cleared,
   for example Shift+Tab from the any context, use the following
   FVWM syntax:
Silent Key Tab A S -


   For more information about bindings context, modifiers,
   PointerKey concept and the rest, see FVWM documentation (man
   page).

8.1. Common User Access (CUA) Key Bindings

   NsCDE 2.1 and above implements multiple sets of key bindings.
   As of NsCDE 2.2, set named cua or Common User Access is applied
   by default, unless overriden in $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf with
   InfoStore variable kbd_bind_set. This can also be configured
   with Keyboard Style Manager. References to the key bindings in
   all other parts of this documentation are reffering to "cua"
   model.

   This subsection describes key bindings implemented in "cua"
   (Common User Access) standard set of key bindings.

     * Control modifier with cursor keys is moving viewport from
       page to page in any context:
          + Ctrl+Up - move viewport one whole page up
          + Ctrl+Down - move viewport one whole page down
          + Ctrl+Left - move viewport one whole page left
          + Ctrl+Right - move viewport one whole page right
     * Meta modifier with cursor keys is moving viewport page by 4
       percent of the screen in any context:
          + Meta+Up - move viewport up by 4%
          + Meta+Down - move viewport down by 4%
          + Meta+Left - move viewport left by 4%
          + Meta+Right - move viewport right by 4%
     * Cursor keys with modifiers Control, Shift and Meta pressed
       together are moving pointer by 1% in any context:
          + Control+Shift+Meta+Up - move mouse pointer by 1% of
            the screen up
          + Control+Shift+Meta+Down - move mouse pointer by 1% of
            the screen down
          + Control+Shift+Meta+Left - move mouse pointer by 1% of
            the screen left
          + Control+Shift+Meta+Right - move mouse pointer by 1% of
            the screen right
     * Pressing Alt+Tab in any context scrolls one page down, then
       wraps up on the lowest page and continues to the right.
     * Pressing Meta+Tab in any context moves viewport to the next
       workspace
     * Pressing Shift+Meta+Tab in any context moves viewport to
       the previous workspace
     * To raise and focus next overlapped window on the current
       page, press Alt+Up in any context, apart from icons.
     * To raise and focus previous overlapped window on the
       current page, press Alt+Down in any context, apart from
       icons.
     * To focus next window on the current page, and move pointer
       to the middle of that window, press Alt+Right in any
       context.
     * To focus next window on the current page, and move pointer
       to the middle of that window, press Alt+Right in any
       context.
     * To focus previous window on the current page, and move
       pointer to the middle of that window, press Alt+Left in any
       context.
     * To focus next window on the current workspace, and move
       pointer to the middle of that window, press Shift+Right in
       any context.
     * To focus previous window on the current workspace, and warp
       pointer to the middle of that window, press Shift+Left in
       any context.
     * To move pointer in the middle of the focused window if
       pointer is outside that window, press Meta+Alt+J in any
       context.
     * To focus next window on the any workspace or page, press
       Meta+Alt+Right in any context.
     * To focus previous window on the any workspace or page,
       press Meta+Alt+Left in any context.
     * To cycle focus of the windows on the current page, press
       Alt+Escape in any context.
     * To pop Window List menu for the current workspace, press
       Ctrl+Escape in any context. Pressing cursor keys Up, Tab or
       Tab in the context of Window List menu, moves up, down and
       then cycles on the first/last item menu item focus.
       Pressing Escape key in the context of Window List menu will
       open extended Window List where windows of all workspaces
       are visible, and separated by the names of workspaces as
       non-clickable menu subtitles. Pressing Escape or Escape for
       the third time in the context of the Window List menu, pops
       down Window List Menu. Pressing Return key on any
       selectable Window List menu item, selects and focuses that
       window and pops down Window List Menu.
     * To shift focus on the icons of the current workspace, press
       Meta+Alt+I in any context apart from icons themselves. In
       the context of icons, this key binding moves focus to the
       next icon if there is no un-iconified windows on the
       current page, or shifts focus to the first un-iconified
       window if such exists on the current page.
     * While the focus is on icons, pressing keys Up or Down
       browses workspace icons by shifting focus between them back
       and forth.
     * Pressing I or SunOpen key in the context of icons,
       deiconifies currently focused icon.
     * Pressing Space+I or Meta+Alt+M keys in the context of
       icons, pops up icons menu, where many operations common for
       iconified windows can be find and called.
     * To pop up Workspace Menu in any context, press Menu (or
       Compose) key fast twice in a row. The same function has the
       Shift+Escape key binding, but pressed once.
     * To pop up Window Operations Menu in any context, press
       Meta+Menu (or Meta+Compose) key binding. Key binding
       Meta+Escape has the same function.
     * To pop up current workspace Local Pager and Front Pager
       Page Manager Menu in the same time, press Meta+Alt+Menu.
       Key binding Meta+Shift+M in any context apart from icons,
       does the same function. While Front Pager Page Manager Menu
       and Local Pager are popped up, keys Up, Down or Tab are
       selecting pages on the menu and cycling trough them.
       Pressing Return key, selects a page, while Local Pager will
       indicate this change and dissapear after a few (or
       configured) number of seconds.
     * To resize (or zoom in) currently focused window by 50
       pixels in all directions, press Meta+F8. Window will be
       placed on it's default position and enlarged by mentioned
       amount of pixels in all directions.
     * To resize (or zoom out) currently focused window by 50
       pixels in all directions, press Shift+Meta+F8. Window will
       be placed on it's default position and shrinked by
       mentioned amount of pixels in all directions.
     * To open a new default terminal window, press Meta+F12 in
       any context.
     * To open built in "Exec" launcher, or advanced Rofi launcher
       if configured, press Alt+F12. This same action can be
       performed on Sun keyboard by pressing SunOpen (XF86Open)
       key in the context of the root window, or with Meta+SunOpen
       in any context.
     * To open Graphical Workspace Manager or "GWM", press
       Meta+Alt+Home key binding. Keys Control+Q if pressed in the
       context of GWM window, will dismiss GWM.
       Figure 59. GWM - Graphical Workspace Manager
       [fig_gwm.png]
     * To open Local Pager, press Meta+Backspace in any context.
       Pressing Meta+Backspace again (but in the context of Local
       Pager) dismisses Local Pager.
       Figure 60. Local Pager
       [fig_localpager.png]
     * To open Global Pager, press Meta+Alt+Backspace in any
       context. Pressing Meta+Alt+Backspace again dismisses Global
       Pager.

       [fig_globalpager.png]
     * To lock the screen if X Screen Saver is enabled, press
       Meta+Alt+L.
     * Combination of keys Meta+Alt+X calls xrandr --auto".
     * To clean up current page or viewport, press Meta+Alt+F5.
       This will iconify and hide (almost) all objects on the
       screen. Pressing Meta+Alt+F5 puts back all windows which
       were affected with Meta+Alt+F5 on that same screen in the
       first run - a toggle action.
     * To pop Window Operations Menu of the currently focused
       window, press Meta+Alt+M in the context of that window or
       it's decorations. This will press first leftmost button on
       the window's title bar and show pop down Windows Operations
       Menu.
     * To open Occupy Workspace dialog for the currently focused
       window, press Meta+Alt+O key binding.
     * To tile windows vertically (move and resize in maximize
       mode) on the current page, press Meta+Alt+R key binding.
       Pressing it again will restore all affected windows to
       their default positions, but maximized windows will be in
       the restored state.
     * To tile windows horizontally (move and resize in maximize
       mode) on the current page, press Meta+Alt+H key binding.
       Pressing it again will restore all affected windows to
       their default positions, but maximized windows will be in
       the restored state.
     * XF86PowerOff on Sun keyboards (most upper right) and some
       other keyboards opens System Action Dialog with system
       suspend (S3) option selected. For this to work, ACPI action
       needs to be configured on the system to give FVWM window
       manager control. Otherwise, this will likely initiate
       direct system shutdown.
     * Ctrl+XF86PowerOff opens System Action Dialog with system
       shutdown option selected. For this to work, ACPI action
       needs to be configured on the system. Otherwise, this will
       likely initiate direct system shutdown.
     * Alt+XF86PowerOff opens System Action Dialog with system
       reboot option selected. For this to work, ACPI action needs
       to be configured on the system. Otherwise, this will likely
       initiate direct system shutdown.
     * Meta+XF86PowerOff opens System Action Dialog with X Session
       logout option selected. For this to work, ACPI action needs
       to be configured on the system. Otherwise, this will likely
       initiate direct system shutdown.
     * Help key on Sun keyboards if pressed, in the pointer
       context of the root window will call PDF viewer (if any)
       with complete (this) NsCDE documentation.
     * Meta+Help key on Sun keyboards if pressed, in any context
       will call PDF viewer (if any) with complete (this) NsCDE

     * Alt+F10 grows window up to the first obstacle on page, when
       pressed again, it maximizes window ~ 86% - avoids Front
       Panel; when pressed further, it maximizes to 100% (whole
       screen + decorations); third call to Alt+F10 restores
       window into it's normal state. We can say how window is
       cycling between normal, grow, stretched and maximized
       state. This is a cyclic keybinding in a "grow" direction.

     * Meta+F10 is the same as Meta+F10. This variant is presented
       on Window Operations menu for actions when going towards
       bigger maximized state, while Meta+F7 is presented for
       actions which are shrinking back.
     * Alt+F11 maximizes window 100% (whole screen + decorations);
       when pressed again it maximizes to 86% (stretch), third
       press will put window in the grow state (Maximized on page
       up to the first obstacle), while third press should put
       window into normal state. We can say how window is cycling
       between normal, grow, stretched and maximized state. This
       is a cyclic keybinding in a "shrink" direction.

     * Meta+F11 Works like Alt+F11, but selects every second
       operation. In practice, from restored state goes to
       stretched and back, and from grow state goes to fully
       maximized and back.
     * Key Meta+Space in the context of the window, frame corners,

8.2. NsCDE 1.X Key Bindings

   This subsection explains key bindings implemented in the
   deprecated "nscde1x" set of key bindings. For those who are
   using this set, this subsection applies as documentation of key
   bindings.

   This mechanism was still experimental in NsCDE 2.1 and the only
   implemented set of keybindings was this one - nscde1x (called
   "nscde" in NsCDE 2.1). The following section lists and explains
   key bindings implemented in that set. In version 2.2 of NsCDE,
   IBM CUA compliant set is implemented as an new default choice
   to old "nscde1x" set of keybindings. Please bear in mind that
   references to the key bindings in all other parts of this
   documentation are reffering to "cua" model, not this one.

     * cursor keys up, down, left and right with ctrl modifier are
       moving viewport from page to page in any context.
     * cursor keys up, down, with Alt modifier are cycling window
       focus and raises or lowers them on the current page in all
       contexts except icon
     * cursor keys up, down, left and right, with meta (mod4) are
       moving viewport by 4% of the screen. (Ctrl moves 100%)
     * the same cursor keys as above, but with shift modifier
       moves pointer by 1% of the screen
     * Meta+Alt+I in any context apart from icon context will move
       focus and pointer to icons on the currect page (if any).
       Here, Up and Down keys can be used to browse icons. In the
       context of icon itself, this keybinding will choose last
       non-iconified window and move off focus from icons.
     * Up/Down in the context of a icon focuses first icon above
       or below of the current selected and focused icon. Key
       Space will bring main icon menu in the context of the
       focused icon.
     * I in the context of the icon deiconifies that icon.
     * Menu (Compose) key, if pressed twice in a time window of
       two seconds pops up root menu in any context. On keyboards
       without Menu (Compose) key, combination
       Alt+ISO_Level3_Shift does the same thing
     * Meta+Menu combination pops up root Window Operations Menu
       On keyboards without Menu (Compose) key, combination
       Meta+ISO_Level3_Shift does the same thing
     * Meta+Alt+Menu pressed twice, brings up page menu on the
       Front Panel and Local Pager in the middle of the screen if
       enabled. On keyboards without Menu (Compose), combination
       Meta+Alt+U does the same thing
     * Meta+Alt+Home will spawn or raise and focus if already
       active - a Graphical Workspace Manager or GWM.
     * Meta+Alt+N Cycles window focus between all windows on the
       current page, raises them, and moves pointer to them
     * Meta+Alt+B Same as Meta+Alt+N but in backward direction
     * Meta+Shift+N Cycles window focus between all windows on the
       current workspace, raises them, and moves pointer to them
     * Meta+Shift+B Same as Meta+Shift+N but in backward direction
     * Meta+Alt+J Moves pointer to the focused window if pointer
       is not already there
     * Space in the icon frame context pops up icon-specific
       contextual menu
     * Key Meta+Alt+Insert will give a focus to the last opened
       window
     * Key Meta+Alt+BackSpace will give a focus to the previously
       focused window
     * Shift+BackSpace If pressed twice in a time frame of two
       seconds will call LocalPager in any context. This Pager
       will disappear soon as it looses a pointer focus, or if
       keybinding is pressed again once, while pager is still
       visible.
     * Shift+TabCalls visual GlobalPager, a stripped down version
       of GWM (Graphical Workspace Manager) which shows matrix of
       pages and workspaces. This keybinding works in any context,
       but it must be called twice to avoid accidental invocation.
       When Global Pager is visible, calling it second time while
       focused will close Global Pager. In it's stripped down
       semi-transient mode, this pager, if not called as full GWM
       will disappear shortly after losing mouse focus, to free up
       space on the screen.
       Figure 65. Global Pager
       [fig_globalpager.png]
     * Alt+Tab is cycling trough pages of the active page of the
       current workspace from up to down and then right up to down
     * Meta+Tab is cycling trough the all workspaces (desks)
     * Meta+Shift+Tab is reverse cycling trough the all workspaces
       (desks)
     * Meta+Alt+L activates screensaver, that is, locks the screen
     * Meta+Alt+X Executes "xrandr --auto"
     * Meta+Alt+W will call f_CleanRestoreWorkspace function. This
       will iconify and put into invisible group all iconified
       windows on the active page. Repeating this action once
       again, restores all iconified windows back in place quickly
       and without animation. Windows which were iconified before
       calling this action or from windows started and iconified
       after this action are not affected by this function. This
       is NsCDE smart version of the "show desktop" functionality.
       Individual windows from the group can be deiconified too,
       which will sign off this windows from the group.
     * Key Meta+Alt+Min the context of the window, frame corners,
       frame sides and a title bar pops up Window Options context
       menu. In the context of an icon, it brings Icon Operations
       Menu, similar to Window Operations Menu.

       [fig_nscde1x_menu.png]
     * Key Meta+Alt+O - same as Meta+Space if called in the window
       context.
     * Key Meta+Alt+R - Vertically tiles windows of the current
       page in a grid, making them "grow" maximized state (See
       Alt+F7 and Alt+F8).
     * Key Meta+Alt+H - Horizontally tiles windows of the current
       page in a grid, making them "grow" maximized state (See
       Alt+F7 and Alt+F8).
     * Meta+Alt+E Again executes last selected item from the last
       used subpanel. From the Sun keyboard, this can also be
       accomplished with Meta+Sun Again (Redo).
     * Meta+Escape Will cycle trough focus-accepting windows on
       the current page of the current desk, avoiding
       CirculateSkip windows and the FrontPanel.
     * Alt+Escape Will open WindowList in the middle of the screen
       for the current workspace (desk) if pressed twice, local
       WindowList will be replaced with global WindowList
     * XF86PowerOff on Sun keyboards (most upper right) calls
       System Action Dialog with system suspend (S3) option
       selected. For this to work, ACPI action needs to be
       configured on the system. Otherwise, this will likely
       initiate direct system shutdown.
     * Ctrl+XF86PowerOff on Sun keyboards (most upper right) calls
       System Action Dialog with system shutdown option selected.
       For this to work, ACPI action needs to be configured on the
       system. Otherwise, this will likely initiate direct system
       shutdown.
     * Alt+XF86PowerOff on Sun keyboards (most upper right) calls
       System Action Dialog with system reboot option selected.
       For this to work, ACPI action needs to be configured on the
       system. Otherwise, this will likely initiate direct system
       shutdown.
     * Meta+XF86PowerOff on Sun keyboards (most upper right) calls
       System Action Dialog with X Session logout option selected.
       For this to work, ACPI action needs to be configured on the
       system. Otherwise, this will likely initiate direct system
       shutdown.
     * Help key on Sun keyboards if pressed twice in a second, in
       the context of the root window will call PDF viewer (if
       any) with complete (this) NsCDE documentation.
     * Sun Front key on Sun keyboards acts as a Alt+F6 - Raise or
       Lower the window.
     * Sun Find key on Sun keyboards calls f_Find NsCDE FVWM
       function which has to be user defined to be usefull.
     * Sun Props key on Sun keyboards will call Style Manager
       window when pointer is on the root window.
     * Sun Meta+Props key on Sun keyboards will call Style Manager
       window.
     * Sun Open same as Alt+F12 invokes Exec dialog or Rofi
       launcher if configured with nscde_use_rofi infostore
       variable in the $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf
     * XF86AudioLowerVolume and XF86AudioRaiseVolume on Sun type 6
       or 7 keyboards will lower and raise sound volume by 1
       percent, or by 10 percent if combined with Ctrl modifier.
       This works by default on systems on which pactl(1)
       PulseAudio tool is installed. On other systems, f_Mixer
       function has to be redefined. See
       $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Keybindings.<kbd_bind_set> for f_Mixer
       options and interaction.
     * XF86AudioMute key on Sun keyboards will mute the sound.
       Function f_Mixer expects PulseAudio system. See previous
       item for possible alternatives.
     * Shift+BackSpace if pressed twice in a short time frame will
       spawn Local Pager under the pointer. Pressend second time
       just once, it will dismiss Local Pager
     * Key Meta+Space in the context of the window, frame corners,
       frame sides, title bar and icon (ovoids root window
       context!) calls Occupy Workspace dialog for window moving
       between the desks.

       Panel and it's EWMH panel area
     * Titlebar 3rd (rightmost) button middle click: (Un)Maximizes
       86% and makes window sticky or unsticks it depending on
       window's initial state
     * Titlebar 3rd (rightmost) button right click: (Un)Maximizes
       86% and makes window raise or lower depending on window's
       initial state
     * Titlebar left click: Moves window on move, raises/lowers on
       click
     * Titlebar middle click: pops up menu with functions to take
       a screenshot of the window, identify with info (FvwmIdent),
       xprop(1), and xwininfo(1)
     * Titlebar right mouse button quickly raises or lowers a
       window
     * Pointer actions 4 and 5 (mouse wheel) are shading and
       unshading (rollup, rolldown) a window
     * Left pointer click on border or corner raises or lowers a
       window while move action will interactively resize the
       window
     * Middle pointer click on border or corner will only do
       lower/raise action, without resize on pointer movement
     * Right pointer click on border or corner also does
       lower/raise action, but on pointer movement moves the
       window
     * Left pointer click in combination with control on border or
       corner will popup Window Operations Menu as if first
       titlebar button was pressed once.
     * Middle pointer click in combination with control on border
       or corner will popup Occupy Workspace dialog.
     * Right pointer click in combination with control on border
       or corner calls root applications menu (MenuFvwmRoot) -
       this rare and border functionality is aimed for difficult
       situations where there is no other option easily available
     * Left pointer click in combination with meta on border or
       corner will refresh that window.
     * Right pointer click in combination with meta on border or
       corner will reposition window as if Reposition or Alt+F3
       was called.

       actions.
     * Left double click on the root window calls Window
       Operations.
     * Middle click calls FVWM WindowList super-menu see fvwm(1)
       for WindowList
     * Right click calls main root menu MenuFvwmRoot
     * Pointer actions 4 and 5 (mouse wheel) will scroll between
       current up and down pages of the current workspace by 2% if
       pointer is in the context of the root window
     * Control+ left mouse click will call f_CleanRestoreWorkspace
       function. This will iconify and put into invisible group
       all iconified windows on the active page. Repeating this
       action once again, restores all iconified windows back in
       place quickly and without animation. Windows which were
       iconified before calling this action or from windows
       started and iconified after this action are not affected by
       this function. This is NsCDE smart version of the "show
       desktop" functionality.
     * Control+ middle mouse click will call extended version of
       the WindowList with additional window info such as page
       number and window geometry.

9. Configuration files explained

   As pointed above, NsCDE has a number of configuration files.
   Approximately 75% of them are the FVWM configurations, where a
   line between using FVWM directives for it's core and modular
   functionality as a desktop-building material and tool, and
   merely configuring aspects for end use are wastly blurred and
   cannot be really distinguished and separated in that strict
   categories. This system of configurations is arranged in some
   logical and consistent way. For example, keyboard shortcuts in
   Keybindings.<kbd_bind_set>, FvwmBacker configuration in
   Backer.fvwmconf, (generated) colorsets in Colorset.fvwmgen etc.

   All this configurations are included from the Main.fvwmconf.
   This is the starting FVWM configuration which sets core options
   and safe defaults, and reads the rest of the configuration
   files which are included there. It defines StartFunction which
   starts all additional modules and calls important things during
   start or restart of the Window Manager. System Wide
   configuration files are located in $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm and
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults, while user local hooks or user
   complete overrides are stored in $FVWM_USERDIR.

   This is default list of system-wide configurations:
     __________________________________________________________

9.1. FrontPanel.actions

   A non-FVWM file. Lines in this file are default actions and
   icons for Front Panel. This file is parsed by the fpexec and
   fpseticon shell script tools. All or individual entries from
   this file can be overridden by creating
   $FVWM_USERDIR/FrontPanel.actions file. This is a CSV-like file
   (comma is a field separator), and it defines buttons of the
   Front Panel, their actions and icons.

   File format is:

     * Button Number (Btn1, Btn2, BtnN ...)
     * Icon path (FVWM relative from ImagePath)
     * Mouse Button (3 mouse buttons for 3 different actions if
       needed)
     * Program executable to check for or NOCHK for check
       avoidance
     * Actions (commands) with options and arguments to the end of
       the line

   If Icon Path field is __APPLET__ for mouse button 1, then in
   the check/nocheck field an applet program may be defined for
   FvwmButtons based Front Panel to be swallowed instead of an
   icon. In this field, direct FvwmButtons(1) syntax must be
   manually written with this exceptions:

     * Comma (,) must be replaced with a pipe (|)
     * Double quotes (") must be escaped by the two backslashed
       (\\)

   If the swallowed applet has it's own action on mouse buttons
   clicks, then declaration of the applet must be prefixed with a
   ActionIgnoresClientWindow. In this case, last filed with the
   actions can be "Nop" because Front Panel will not accept this
   clicks (it may accept them if possible transparent area around
   applet exists and is clicked). If the applet is not clickable,
   a standard FVWM Action or command can be put in the last field
   to make a click on the applet useful.

   Here is the example of the custom swallowed applet. This one
   was initially created for the Window Maker window manager:
   Btn10,__APPLET__,M1,
   "ActionIgnoresClientWindow| Swallow (Respawn) \\"WmstickynotesApplet\
\"
   \\"Exec exec wmstickynotes\\"",Nop

   Btn10,,M2,FVWM,Nop

   Btn10,,M3,FVWM,f_FrontPanelPropsMenu 10 APPLET


   Figure 68. Visual: resulting applet on the Front Panel

   [fig_cust_applet.png]

   Here is the example of the custom swallowed applet which does
   not accept mouse clicks:
   Btn10,__APPLET__,M1,
   "Swallow (Respawn) \\"MyFavoriteApplet\\"
   \\"Exec exec mfa -s\\"",Exec exec vlc

   Btn10,,M2,FVWM,Nop

   Btn10,,M3,FVWM,f_FrontPanelPropsMenu 10 VLC


   This example is replacing standard Front Panel Clock with
   Solaris Globe Icon based Front Panel clock, using the same
   pclock program as standard one, but with a slightly different
   options:
   Btn1,__APPLET__,M1,"Swallow (Respawn) \\"pclock\\"
   \\"Exec exec $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/$(uname -s)_$(uname -m)/fpclock
   -H red -S white --hands-width=4
   --hour-hand-length=15 --minute-hand-length=20
   --second-hand-length=22 -w
   -B $NSCDE_DATADIR/icons/NsCDE/SDtEarth.l.xpm\\",Exec exec firefox

   Btn1,,M2,FVWM,Nop

   Btn1,,M3,FVWM,f_FrontPanelPropsMenu 1 Browser


   Notice that button definition for mouse M1 (first line) is
   split in 3 lines in this examples, but in the
   FrontPanel.actions must be written as one line.

   After editing this file (system-wide or user's) nothing needs
   to be reloaded because file is read from the f_FrontPanelAction
   function on every click on every icon on the Front Panel. There
   is no GUI tool for fully managing this file yet, but currently,
   Copy to Main Panel action from the submenu will edit
   FrontPanel.actions and put choosen entry there, binding it to
   the choosen button. Options Move Button Left and Move Button
   Right from the contextual menu of icons on the main panel will
   push icons and their subpanels (if enabled) left or right,
   implicitly editing FrontPanel.actions in that way.
     __________________________________________________________

9.2. AppMenus.conf

   This file defines which custom menu entries will be appended on
   the Window Options menu when this menu is called by titlebar
   button 1. This is for example used by all known terminal
   applications to implement Wide Terminal menu entry. By default,
   Watch Errors and Fvwm Diagnostic Console have appended
   appropriate entries for conveniently call each other. Also,
   some of the known File Managers has this entry for opening new
   window of the same type. Entries in this file are the following
   comma separated values (syntax):

     * X11 Window Class
     * X11 Window Resource
     * Menu item title (and optionally keyboard shortcut after two
       TAB's)
     * FVWM Exec or function command, module or action to be
       executed

   This file exists as the $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/AppMenus.conf,
   but it can be extended by creating and writing
   $FVWM_USERDIR/AppMenus.conf file.
     __________________________________________________________

9.3. Animate.fvwmconf / Animate.fvwmgen

   FVWM Animate Module configuration. Animate module is started by
   NsCDE by default automatically, but with None as a default
   effect. This can be reconfigured by the user in private
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Animate.fvwmgen with Window Style Manager, or in
   static manual configuration $[FVWM_USERDIR]Animate.fvwmconf. No
   effect (None) is choosen as default for increased CDE
   similarity, because CDE doesn't have iconification animation
   effects.
     __________________________________________________________

9.4. Backdrops.fvwmgen

   This file defines 8 colorsets for all (maximal) 8 desktops as a
   TiledPixmap colorset type. In the system configuration, static
   non-generated configuration (.fvwmconf) defines pre-generated
   default backdrops of default Broica color scheme. When user
   makes the first change with Backdrop Style Manager, user's
   private copy of this file is created in $FVWM_USERDIR. In
   NsCDE, colorsets 31 - 38 are reserved for backdrops (or png,
   xpm photos).
     __________________________________________________________

9.5. Backer.fvwmconf

   Rarely needed in $FVWM_USERDIR. FvwmBacker(1) configuration
   which defines 8 maximum desks and refers them to 8 colorsets
   from 31 - 38. Option RetainPixmap is defined in case user wants
   to use X compositor such as compton(1) with NsCDE.
     __________________________________________________________

9.6. Colorset.fvwmgen

   Definition of all colorsets minus colorsets 31 - 38 which are
   reserved for the backdrops. System-wide file has predefined
   color values for default color scheme (Broica), while user's
   file in $FVWM_USERDIR is created on first change made with
   Color Style Manager. Apart from FVWM colorsets, this file
   exports in environment two variables: NSCDE_PALETTE with the
   name of the color palette used in generation of the file, and
   NSCDE_PALETTE_NCOLORS which is either 4 or 8, depending which
   color variant has been used in Color Style Manager.
     __________________________________________________________

9.7. NsCDE.conf

   This file defines various FVWM and NsCDE defaults. NsCDE.conf
   can be considered as the main user's configuration file. System
   wide configuration are static defaults which can be loaded by
   Window Style Manager or by erasing user's copy of the file.
   User's copy of the NsCDE.conf contains all options (minus
   FvwmAnimate) from Window Style Manager's set of options, but it
   has some options such as FVWM infostore variables for default
   terminal and file manager applications, graphical editor, and
   such. Infostore variables desknum, pagematrixX and pagematrixY
   are managed by the Workspace and Pages Manager while
   menudclicktm infostore variable is managed by the Pointer Style
   Manager. In NsCDE.conf, defaults for page edges, focus, icons,
   and such are defined. See Section 5.19 and fvwm(1) for details.
   Since this is read by FVWM, user can set in this file local
   variables and additional configuration options if needful,
   which are not covered in other parts of the configuration.
   While applications are taking great care with long regexp lines
   to parse and write this file, if edited manually, user is
   advised to keep it clean: use proper capitalization as it is
   described in fvwm(1), without line breaks and if possible,
   surplus spaces and tabs. Comments are allowed as usual: as
   lines which begins with # sign.

   Further, common system environment variables are provided
   already set, or for optional uncommenting if needed or
   desirable:

     * QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME - set to "qt5ct"
     * HAS_WINDOWNAME 1 - uncomment and set it to 1 if FVWM is
       patched with additional FvwmButtons NsCDE patches. On
       FVWM3, this is default
     * GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING 0 - handy to turn off irritating
       blinking of scrollbar area in GTK3 applications
     * SetEnv GTK_CSD 0 - if you have misfortune to must use some
       of the GNOME 3 applications and have gtk3-nocsd installed
     * f_VarAppend : LD_PRELOAD /usr/local/lib/libgtk3-nocsd.so.0
       - if you have misfortune to must use some of the GNOME 3
       applications and have gtk3-nocsd installed
     * SetEnv NSCDE_REDRAW_WORKAROUND 1 - Uncomment this if you
       are having problems with FvwmScript PopupMenu widgets under
       compton, compton-ng or picom in the form of not refreshing
       their part of the screen.
     __________________________________________________________

9.8. Event.fvwmconf

   FvwmEvent(1) module configuration. In this file a single
   instance of the FvwmEvent called MainLoop is defined. It passes
   ID (Window ID, desk etc ... depending on context) for window
   manager actions. Cmd option is empty: FVWM functions are used
   for all defined actions. The following events are observed and
   reacted by functions Currently:

     * new_desk
     * new_page
     * add_window
     * destroy_window
     * focus_change
     * enter_window
     * leave_window
     * configure_window
     * iconify
     * deiconify
     * res_class
     * map

   Event Functions from Functions.fvwmconf are triggered on the
   events above. This serves Workspace Manager, Page Manager (PGM)
   and window placement functions in an important way. If
   redefined or disabled, things will start to break. It can be
   extended by the user to suit the needs in
   $NSCDE_USERDIR/Event.fvwmlocal, but here also care must be
   taken, because complex functions, or calling slow and/or
   resource hungry commands from that functions can make FVWM (and
   hence NsCDE) dramatically slow and even unstable.
     __________________________________________________________

9.9. Font-<NSCDE_FONT_DPI>dpi.fvwmgen

   ... where "DPI" ($NSCDE_FONT_DPI) is by default hardcoded to
   96.

   This files are regular files in the system-wide configuration,
   but may be symbolic links to some system wide or local fontset
   in $FVWM_USERDIR when generated by Font Style Manager.

   Font sizes in this config are defined as infostore variables
   and used across FVWM config files, they are provided to
   FvwmScript programs with getfont wrapper. Font sizes are in
   points. While defining them in pixels (pixelsize=) will be
   easier, and all this care about DPI will not be needed,
   integration with GTK2 and GTK3 in best of my knowledge and
   research does not provide a way to define fonts in pixel sizes,
   so either font sizes in points or unsure recalculation (again
   based on DPI) will be needed while writing gtk settings.
     __________________________________________________________

9.10. Form.fvwmconf

   Defaults for fonts, colorsets, cursors etc of FVWM form module.
   FvwmForm is reading this. FvwmForm is not used actively by
   NsCDE anymore, This file and definitions in it are provided
   only to enforce colors and fonts in accordance with the current
   NsCDE theme if any custom installation decides to use forms
   again.
     __________________________________________________________

9.11. FrontPanel.fvwmX.fvwmconf

   Main NsCDE Front Panel configuration file. Here, FvwmButtons is
   configured under the alias *FrontPanel. Special care is taken
   to place most of configurable parts out of this file, so it
   doesn't have to be forked into $FVWM_USERDIR, but this option
   nevertheless exists. Here, all geometry, buttons, subpanels,
   default icons, frames and widgets are written and put in place.
   This configuration, together with swallowed WSM (Workspace
   Manager) is probably the most recognizable part of the setup
   which provides us with familiar and desired CDE look - a Front
   Panel. FvwButtons FrontPanel configuration is non-trivial, but
   it is very trustworthy mimicking the original. Icon actions
   which user wants to change here can be overridden with
   FrontPanel.actions file and Subpanels which are also described
   here. Swallowed apps and "widgets" are in most part already
   described in sections above.

   In NsCDE 2.0, FrontPanel has double configuration: in two
   separate configuration files. One is for fvwm2
   (FrontPanel.fvwm2.fvwmconf) and the second for fvwm3
   (FrontPanel.fvwm3.fvwmconf) a "front" file FrontPanel.fvwmconf
   contains the code for auto detection of FVWM (patched fvwm2
   will use fvwm3 file if detected).
     __________________________________________________________

9.12. Functions.fvwmconf

   Another important part of the configuration. Almost all FVWM
   functions are defined here, except 5-6 of core functions in
   Main.fvwmconf which are reading the rest of the configuration.
   They are sorted in logical groups and are used widely in almost
   every part of the configuration, and particularly from the
   FvwmScript scripts. Main groups of NsCDE FVWM functions are:

     * Core Window Operation Functions
     * Front Panel functions
     * Misc core functions
     * Functions called from FvwmEvent MainLoop
     * Functions for generating menus
     * Placeholders for functions aimed for user to override
     * Functions used in NsCDE FvwmScripts
     * Upgrade Functions

   For a FVWM function description see fvwm(1), in this file there
   is a plethora of examples, and for user usage is the most
   interesting part placeholders for functions which are here
   merely for programs to not complain about missing them and
   which should be overridden in user's local extension
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Functions.fvwmlocal - this extension file will be
   read by the main configuration immediately after processing
   Functions.fvwmconf. This functions are:

     * f_CheckMail: called by CheckMailApplet on the FrontPanel on
       click and periodically. This is the place where some script
       can be called and with SendToModule to "1 1" (widget 1,
       routine 1) icon of empty mailbox will be changed to the
       icon of the full mailbox.
     * f_Calendar: called by MonthDayApplet on click. Can be used
       to call external calendar application, to focus Thunderbird
       with lightning extension or whatever user finds useful.
     * f_Mixer: unused currently.
     * f_AddCustomToRootMenu: add custom entries in a convenient
       point of the root menu which is called by the right mouse
       button on the root window.
     * f_UserChangeDesk: called when current active workspace
       changes
     * f_UserChangePage: called when current active page changes
     * f_UserRestartFunction: hook called when NsCDE restarts
     * f_UserEnterWindow: hook called when window is entered
     * f_UserLeaveWindow: hook called when focus leaves window

   Another useful function is conditional execution function
   f_WarpOrExec. It takes 3+ arguments. First is the window name
   or class (or icon, resource) name, second is the binary to
   check in $PATH>, and 3rd to the rest of the command line is
   what to execute with all arguments included. If window with
   name from arg1 is already present on $DISPLAY, it will not be
   executed, but pointer will be simply pointed to that window. If
   window was iconified, or function called from another workspace
   or page, window will be deiconified, and workspace and/or
   current page changed to one where existing window is residing.

   It is pointless and bad idea for this file to be overridden by
   the local copy of the conf (fvwmconf, not fvwmlocal) file,
   because a lot of things depends on this functions. Regular
   update of NsCDE software version will almost certain make setup
   with missing or incompatible functions.
     __________________________________________________________

9.13. IconMan.fvwmconf

   If Use Icon Box option is selected in the Window Style Manager,
   infostore variable iconbox will be defined as non-zero, and
   FvwmIconMan(1) module will be started on login from the
   Main.fvwmconf. This file, IconMan.fvwmconf contains default
   configuration of that module.
     __________________________________________________________

9.14. Ident.fvwmconf

   Module FvwmIdent(1) is called either from a small menu which
   can be popped up with middle pointer click on a titlebar, or
   from the root window version of the Window Options menu. This
   is FvwmIdent's configuration file. It simply defines colorset
   and font for the FvwmIdent's module window.
     __________________________________________________________

9.15. Init.fvwmconf

   Most probable candidate for copying to $FVWM_USERDIR. Here are
   defined start, quit and restart function (sessionless and
   session-managed) which are internally recognized by FVWM during
   certain important actions. InitFunction or SessionInitFunction
   is the place to put all programs and actions user wants to be
   executed during NsCDE startup. In system-wide default
   configuration there are already conditionally defined some
   probable applications and there are hints and examples for user
   to customize this further.
     __________________________________________________________

9.16. Keybindings.fvwmconf

   This file is a kind of a wrapper. According to the value of the
   $[infostore.kbd_bind_set] it will read either Keybindings.cua
   or Keybindings.nscde1x file, as well as menu-bounded
   keybindings from the
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/Keymenu-cua.actions or
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/Keymenu-nscde1x.actions. This are the
   two sets of key bindings: "nscde1x" implements non-standard and
   arbitrary choice key bindings used until NsCDE 2.1, while "cua"
   implements IBM Common User Access rules, which are more in
   compliance with other environments and also CDE. According to
   the old CDE documentation, there are only couple of key
   bindings known under CDE if we condider window manager and DE,
   not the Motif and X resources of individual applications. In
   both this sets of key bindings, NsCDE tries to combine a CDE
   legacy with a number of new functions and shortcuts, originally
   not present in CDE. It is recommended to use more standard and
   more structured new "cua" set of key bindings. For a
   describtion of all key bindings, see chapter Common User Access
   (CUA) Key Bindings or NsCDE 1.X Key Bindings.
     __________________________________________________________

9.17. Keymenu-<kbd_bind_set>.actions

   This file is not FVWM configuration file. It is written
   manually (with editor), and read by the $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/keymenu
   command which will generate infostore variables with
   descriptive keyboard shortcut names which are used in NsCDE
   menus from Menus.fvwmconf and Functions.fvwmconf, and
   additionaly, use the whole line after the keyword in the first
   column with "Silent Key" prefix to dinamically generate this
   part of keybindings which are separated from
   Keybindings.fvwmconf (Keybindings.<keybindings set>) and
   processed specially because they definition must automatically
   match keyboard binding description in various menus. The
   "<kbd_bind_set>" represents keybindings set called from default
   Main.fvwmconf or $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf with variable
   kbd_bind_set. Default is "nscde1x".

   The syntax of this file is simple: first column is the keyword
   which becomes infostore variable (km_xrefresh as
   $[infostore.km_xrefresh]), and the rest columns of every line
   is FVWM "Key" sintax which is paired with "Silent Key" prefix
   during initialization with f_KeyMenu -a from Main.fvwmconf.

   Every line, or dynamic keybinding can be overriden here if
   (re)defined in user's $FVWM_USERDIR/Keymenu.actions: whole file
   or just choosen keybindings. The goal is to get their
   descriptions (after functions and menus reload) automatically
   in place on menus. For example, "F3 A M" configuration for FVWM
   "Key" will become Alt+F3 description right of the (De)Shade
   item on titlebar left button popdown menu.

   File Keymenu-<kbd_bind_set>.actions is processed by
   $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/keymenu script. This script generates FVWM
   infostore variables used in menus, and executes FVWM "Key"
   commands producing dynamic keybindings which are described in
   menus. Additionally, it will read user's
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Keymenu.actions if that file exists.

   For a list of keybindings that are "dynamic", that is, not
   defined in Keybindings.<kbd_bind_set>, but in
   Keymenu-<kbd_bind_set>.actions, see notices in section about
   NsCDE 1.X Key Bindings or Common User Access (CUA) Key
   Bindings.
     __________________________________________________________

9.18. Mousebindings.fvwmconf

   File Mousebindings.fvwmconf is made in similar manner as the
   Keybindings.<kbd_bind_set>. Can be overridden (.fvwmconf) or
   extended (.fvwmlocal) just like (almost) any NsCDE conf file.
   See fvwm(1) for "Mouse" commands. Here, commands invoked with
   pointer are defined. As it is the case with a Key Bindings,
   there are considerable more mouse actions in NsCDE than in
   original CDE. The syntax is described at the top of the file,
   similar to this of Key Bindings.

   Default set of mouse bindings in NsCDE is described in the
   chapter about Mouse Bindings.
     __________________________________________________________

9.19. Main.fvwmconf

   Core configuration. This file is read as first initialization
   upon starting FVWM Window Manager. In fact, FVWM is invoked
   with -f /path/to/Main.fvwmconf to read it instead of default
   FVWM system configuration or user's ~/.fvwm/config. This
   invocation and configuration in Main.fvwmconf changes
   everything: it avoids ~/.fvwm if user has a plain (normal) FVWM
   setup, defines and redefines FVWM internal variables and sets
   NSCDE_ROOT, configures some core FVWM options (like
   DefaultIcon), defines main FVWM Read command wrapper f_ReadCfg,
   sets desktop names, reads NsCDE.conf depending if user has it,
   or system-wide one, defines StartFunction, DesktopSize, and
   then reads most of the files described in this documents,
   composing NsCDE FVWM configuration. Care must be taken NOT to
   read this file with f_ReadCfg, because it will end up in the
   endless CPU hogging loop because f_ReadCfg will be destroyed
   and recreated during it's own execution. This file should never
   be overridden in $FVWM_USERDIR. It is the init(8) of the NsCDE
   system.
     __________________________________________________________

9.20. Menus.fvwmconf

   In NsCDE, there is a bunch of the menus. Root menus, contextual
   menus, and even menus called or dinamically generated from the
   FvwmScript(1) scripts.

     * MenuFvwmRoot built-in root menu of FVWM. As in CDE, menu of
       such type, it is called with a right click on the root
       window.
     * m_Applications - main and dynamically generated menu with a
       FVWM python script fvwm-menu-desktop (contains flat list of
       apps and icons for Front Panel's subpanels). It reads
       /etc/xdg/menus/<desk>-applications.menu
     * m_QuickMenu beneath m_Applications. Empty by default.
       Intended to be destroyed and recreated by the user
       (Menus.fvwmlocal) with own favorites.
     * m_NsCDEHelpMenu beneath Quick Menu. Contains links to this
       documentation in PDF and HTML forms.
     * m_NsCDEMenu on the top of generated Applications menu.
       Contains entries to various the NsCDE internal tools. in
       PDF and HTML forms.
     * m_MoveToPage: invoked from the 1st titlebar button. Moves
       window to the specified page on desk
     * m_MoveToWorkspace: as m_MoveToPage, but moves across desks.
       Invoked with middle pointer on the 1st titlebar button
     * m_ControlFrontPanelMenu: Front Panel specific functions.
       Invoked from the left top control panel menu button on
       right pointer click
     * m_DeiconifyOnPage: submenu of the main icon menu invoked
       with the 1st pointer click on desktop icon, deiconify
       window on another page
     * m_FrontPanelWinMenu: Front Panel flavor of the Window
       Operations menu. Invoked from the top left menu button of
       the Front Panel
     * m_IconM2: calls small menu with FvwmIdent, xwininfo and
       xprop if icon is clicked with a middle pointer button
     * m_IconOps: main icon menu invoked with a click on the icon.
       Contains Icon flavor of the "Window Operations" menu,
       submenus (see above) and deiconify action
     * m_SubpanelWindowOps: a Subpanel flavor of the Window
       Operations menu. Invoked from the Subpanel's titlebar left
       (and only) button contains also contextual actions Refresh
       Subpanel and Subpanel Settings
     * m_TitleBarM2: Middle pointer click on titlebar. Invokes a
       small menu which gives FvwmIdent, xwininfo, xprop, and two
       to four types of screenshot of the window.
     * m_WindowOpsStandard: main menu of Window Operations invoked
       with a mouse click on left titlebar button. It has extended
       (More ...) and reduced (Less ...) version.
     * m_WindowOpsExtended: changes m_WindowOpsStandard from
       default reduced, to extended view (More ... option on
       Window Operation menu)
     * m_RootMenu: Small root menu with options to call Invoked
       with a click on the root window. It has menu items for
       invoking workspace-local window list, global window list,
       local pager, global pager, Window Options menu, and to
       refresh all windows on the screen.
     * m_WindowOpsRootWin: Standalone root window version of the
       Window Operations menu intended for a general and tricky
       circumstances. It is invoked from the m_RootMenu, and
       keybindings Meta+Escape and Meta+Menu.

   For a more detailed guide about important menus, how to invoke
   and use them, see section Using Menus.
     __________________________________________________________

9.21. WspLocPager.fvwmconf

   Configures FvwmPager(1) type which is called as Local Pager
   from the right-click popup menu on Workspace Manager buttons.
   This pager is transient and will disappear after being used
   with a pointer click.
     __________________________________________________________

9.22. LocalPager.fvwmconf

   Figure 69. Local Pager

   [fig_localpager.png]

   Pager which is showing only a current workspace. It's windows
   and pages on thish windows reside. This pager is meant to be
   primary of informational nature. Infostore variable pageraisefp
   in NsCDE.conf is by default 0. If enabled (1), when active page
   or workspace changes, visual FvwmPager(1) will be shown in the
   center of the screen near the top of it by default. On
   Meta+Backspace, pointer will move to the position of the pager,
   it will eventually disappear from the screen after 1 second, 3
   seconds, 5 seconds, 8 seconds, or 10 seconds if it looses the
   pointer focus, or it can be dismissed by pressing the same key
   combination once more while pointer is above pager. Local
   pager's initial appearing position on the active screen can be
   controled with rootpagerposition FVWM InfoStore variable in the
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf. There, a timeout can also be set with
   rootpagertimeout variable; rootpagertimeout is in milliseconds.
     __________________________________________________________

9.23. Script.fvwmconf

   Some bare defaults for all FvwmScript(1) Module based
   applications and widgets: script Path, default font and
   colorset. All this values are usually redefined outside of this
   file, so in FvwmScript source body, nothing really should be
   changed here.
     __________________________________________________________

9.24. WSM.conf

   Non-FVWM config file. Here, the names of the NsCDE Workspaces
   are read and written by the NsCDE and can be changed manually
   or with the Workspaces and Pages Style Manager. Options for
   Graphical Workspace Manager (GWM) are also saved here. Names of
   the workspace pages (for the menus) can be redefined here
   manually (there is no tool for this one).

   WSM file is not read from the system's central location. It is
   installed there only for a reference. WSM.conf will be created
   in $FVWM_USERDIR when workspaces are renamed, or GWM settings
   are changed. Overrides for names of the pages are user's care
   if there is really need to name pages differently from default
   scheme.
     __________________________________________________________

9.25. Style.fvwmconf

   Main decoration configuration. Style '*' is applied globally.
   This is the main source of CDE and Motif-like look and
   behavior. If user wants to preserve CDE-like look and feel,
   this options should not be changed too much. Otherwise, a plain
   FVWM configuration can be done which can drastically differ
   from NsCDE, since FVWM has much more options and variants for a
   huge number of tastes. Style '*' options are partially
   overridden or extended in NsCDE.conf which can be generated
   with Window Style Manager or simply copied from
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm to $FVWM_USERDIR and edited to suit.

   Options in Style.fvwmconf are grouped in 7 categories:

     * Default, or '*' styles
     * Fvwm modules and FvwmScript(1) script specific
     * Some basic sane defaults for common applications
     * Menu styles (not a style commands, but styles anyway)
     * Cursor styles (not a style commands, but styles anyway)
     * Decors "SubpanelsDecor" and "FpDecor" which are slightly
       modifiying Front Panel and it's Subpanels.
     * GeometryWindow directives (FVWM3 only)

   This styles can be extended and/or overridden by the user's own
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Style.fvwmlocal, and core style for all windows
   (*) can be overriden by creating $FVWM_USERDIR/Style.override
   which extends or changes directives for core style from
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Style.fvwmconf prior to applying particular
   application styles and prior to reading
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Style.fvwmlocal.

   Colorsets and fonts used in this configuration are generated
   and stored in Font-$DPIdpi.fvwmgen and Colorset.fvwmgen.

   Man page fvwm(1) has a rich and extended description of what
   can be done with a huge set of Style commands.
     __________________________________________________________

9.26. Subpanels.actions

   This file is not FVWM configuration file. It is written by the
   Subpanels Manager, Subpanel Settings, or manually with editor,
   and read by the $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/generate_subpanels command
   which will generate Subpanels.fvwmX.fvwmconf file in user's
   $FVWM_USERDIR directory, where "fvwmX" is either fvwm2 or fvwm3
   depending under which FVWM NsCDE is running. The syntax of this
   file is simple. It is CSV-like file where values are delimited
   with a comma ",". Every line belongs to one of the ten
   subpanels. Comma and "'" characters cannot be part of the field
   values. This values are:

     * S<X>: where <X> is a number from 1 to 10 indicates which
       subpanel's line is this
     * NAME, WIDTH, ENABLED, ENTRY: second line indicates
       subpanel's display name, subpanel's width regarding font
       and long application names on the menu, state of
       enablement, and entries defined for this subpanel. ENTRY
       lines can be multiple (as much as screen resolution
       allows), other values must be unique for every subpanel.
     * For NAME, WIDTH and ENABLED, there is only a third
       parameter: for a NAME the name of the subpanel, WIDTH is an
       integer (reasonable values: 120 - 260), and enabled is
       boolean 1 or 0.
     * For ENTRY lines, there are fields application title, check
       type, icon path and name, and command with arguments fields
       that must be defined. Title is name of the entry. For
       example "Firefox" or "Workstation Info". Check type can be
       one of "FVWM-M" for FVWM module, "FVWM-F" for FVWM
       function, "OTHER" (currently unused), CHECK:<appname> where
       <appname> is the command which should be checked for
       existance instead of the first string of the command field,
       empty space (nothing between commas: ,,), and NOCHK which
       indicates that no check for a command existance should be
       done in Subpanels.fvwmconf. Most of the entries will
       default to empty which will prepend Test (x <appname>) to
       the entry specification in the resulting FvwmButtons(8)
       config. Icon is full path of the icon file (32x32) which
       should belong to the application. and the rest of the line
       is application's calling command, possibly with options and
       arguments.

9.27. Subpanels.fvwmX.fvwmconf

   The files Subpanels.fvwm2.fvwmconf and Subpanels.fvwm3.fvwmconf
   are generated by the $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/generate_subpanels. It's
   configuration is static in the system directory after NsCDE
   installation, but customizable and easly generated in the
   user's $FVWM_USERDIR where it is then called
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Subpanels.fvwmX.fvwmgen, where "fvwmX" is either
   FVWM2 or FVWM3, depending on which FVWM is used by the NsCDE.
   It contains FvwmButtons(8) definitions of all 20 possible
   subpanels which can be popped up from the Front Panel. There
   are 3 ways to regenerate this file: Subpanels Manager tool
   called from the Install Icon, Subpanel Settings tool called
   from the titlebar popdown menu on every subpanel as Subpanel
   Settings or manually by calling
   $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/generate_subpanels which will read user's or
   system Subpanels.actions for every subpanel and if it exists,
   user's one; take this one while generating
   Subpanels.fvwmX.fvwmconf. In system default, subpanels 2, 5, 6
   and 8 are disabled by default, but can be activated with a very
   quick tripple middle pointer click on the empty launcher
   without up arrow: a Subpanel Settings application will appear
   on the screen which has a checkbox "This Subpanel is Enabled"
   which will be checked out by for disabled subpanels by default,
   and can be checked in, to apply OK will enable subpanel with
   initial system defaults for name, width and application
   entries.

10. System and User NsCDE Tree Layout

   This section describes in detail what is stored where in NsCDE
   system-wide installation hierarchy, and user's home directory
   .NsCDE or $FVWM_USERDIR.
     __________________________________________________________

10.1. System Tree Layout

   From the major version 2, NsCDE is following Filesystem
   Hierarchy Standard of Linux and other surviving Unix and BSD
   systems. The installation procedure will put main calling
   wrapper nscde and nscde_fvwmclnt into PREFIX/bin, NsCDE helper
   programs and tools into PREFIX/libexec/NsCDE, python api code
   and FvwmScript scripts, fpclock and colorpicker binaries into
   PREFIX/lib/NsCDE, while rest of the data goes into
   PREFIX/share/NsCDE, except icon theme, .desktop files, which
   are following XDG specification and are installed in
   /usr/share/icons/NsCDE, /usr/share/applications, and so on.
   NsCDE app menu will be positioned in PREFIX/etc/xdg/menus (or
   /etc/xdg/menus if installed from package), while X session file
   read by the graphical display manager usually goes into
   /usr/share/xsessions, regardless of the PREFIX, or
   /usr/local/share/xsessions on BSD-based systems.

   Variable meanings for further paths:

     * $NSCDE_ROOT
       Main top directory of NsCDE installation; usually /usr,
       /usr/local, /opt/local, /opt/sfw, /usr/pkg etc ... most
       parts of the installation are under this hierarcy
       referenced also as "$PREFIX" in documentation
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR
       This points to $PREFIX/share/NsCDE
     * $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR
       This is sometimes $PREFIX/libexec/NsCDE and some systems,
       which doesn't like libexec will put this as
       $PREFIX/lib/NsCDE, $PREFIX/lib64/NsCDE and so on
     * $NSCDE_LIBDIR
       This is usually $PREFIX/lib/NsCDE with variations as
       $PREFIX/lib64/NsCDE, $PREFIX/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/NsCDE and
       so on.

   This are the main directory components of the NsCDE with
   description what is what, and what is where:

     * bin
       nscde start wrapper called from
       /usr/share/xsessions/nscde.desktop nscde_fvwmclnt caller of
       the right (FVWM2 or FVWM3) FvwmCommand.
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm
       NsCDE private FVWM settings directory. All .fvwmconf files
       described in documentation are here. They are read from
       Main.fvwmconf which is called from PREFIX/bin/nscde by fvwm
       binary with -f directly.
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/config_templates/progbits
       Template X pixmap files used by Color Style Manager for
       producing user's copy in the $FVWM_USERDIR/icons/NsCDE/
       this pixmaps are invalid as pictures in their source form
       since they contain internal macros for replacement with
       real colors. System starting theme is using their copied in
       $NSCDE_DATADIR/icons/NsCDE.
     * $NSCDE_LIBDIR/python
       Python libraries used by themegen: part of the integration
       suite for GTK and Qt theme.
     * $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR
       The rest of the scripts (korn shell and python) are located
       here. In normal circumstances this scripts should not be
       run directly, but they are used by numerous NsCDE
       FvwmScript apps and FVWM functions as helpers and
       background program workers.
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/backdrops
       Backdrop files. CDE and new, additional. Source for
       generation of active user's backdrop depending on theme,
       that is color scheme. They have .pm extension instead of
       .xpm. Bitmap files .bm (.xbm) are not supported by style
       managers and hence some of CDE's original backdrops of that
       type are in NsCDE converted to X pixmaps.
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/icons/cursors
       Custom cursors which are missing on plain X server
       installations but can be found in CDE. Referenced in
       $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Style.fvwmconf.
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/backer
       Default generated backdrops for first start (Broica, 8
       colors) Referenced in system's
       $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Backdrops.fvwmconf.
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/pages
       Default page names for every possible combination supported
       by NsCDE
     * $PREFIX/share/doc/nscde
       Documentation
     * $PREFIX/share/doc/nscde/examples
       Examples for X display manager and DE integrations, sudo
       for shutdown reboot, pm-suspend or pm-hibernate, Gkrellm
       NsCDE skin.
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/fontsets
       Default font sets used by the Font Style Manager
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/icons/NsCDE
       CDE and custom NsCDE icons of which many are part of
       FvwmScript programs and applets
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/palettes
       CDE palettes plus a bunch of new custom palettes. Used by
       Color Style Manager and Backdrop Style Manager, as well as
       $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/themegen, $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/backdropmgr,
       $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/colormgr, $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/palette_colorgen
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/photos
       A couple of nice free photos collected and resized for
       various screen resolutions. Can be used instead of
       backdrops (selectable from Backdrop Style Manager) or in
       $HOME/.xscreensaver for some screensavers which are loading
       photos.
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/config_templates/app-defaults
       X resources for a particular X applications (like XTerm)
       which are processed by the Color Style Manager for user to
       be put into $FVWM_USERDIR/app-defaults (if enabled).
       Referenced by the usual XAPPLRESDIR environment variable.
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/integration/gtk2_gtk3_qt
       Part of the CDE theme which are used by
       $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/themegen and the rest of
       $NSCDE_LIBDIRY/python/*.py to generate $HOME/.themes/NsCDE
       with a selected palette and color depth.
       $NSCDE_DATADIR/config_templates also contains Xdefaults and
       some include files for it, as well as configuration for
       stalonetray which is installed on initial setup, and
       BGdefault, which is a monochrome pixmap loaded as bare
       default early on start, before FvwmBacker(1) sets up
       backdrops on each user's workspace. From there, on initial
       setup, default Xsettingsd.conf, Stalonetray.conf,
       Dunst.conf, colormgr.local and possibly other files are
       installed into user's $FVWM_USERDIR.
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/integration/firefox
       Mozilla Firefox CSS which integrates Firefox Web Browser
       with the current NsCDE theme.
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/integration/thunderbird
       Mozilla Thunderbird CSS which integrates Thunderbird Mail
       Reader with the current NsCDE theme.
     * $NSCDE_DATADIR/integration/rofi
       Template theme for rofi(1) window switcher, launcher, ssh
       dialog and dmenu replacement
     __________________________________________________________

10.2. User Tree Layout

   User part of configuration is located in $HOME/.NSCDE - this
   place is what is referred as $FVWM_USERDIR in this
   documentation. If user has a plain FVWM configuration in
   $HOME/.fvwm it will not be used in any way and can co-exist
   with NsCDE. Here is the simple layout of things in
   $FVWM_USERDIR:

     * app-defaults/ directory:
       X resources referenced by the usual XAPPLRESDIR environment
       variable. Files inside are (will be) generated by the Color
       Style Manager
     * backdrops/ directory:
       If created, user can put custom backdrop sources here, and
       they can than be selected by the Backdrop Style Manager and
       processed with current or custom color scheme.
     * photos/ directory:
       User's photos which can be used instead of backdrops if
       selected in Backdrop Style Manager or configured in
       Backdrops.fvwmgen manually.
     * backer/ directory:
       Generated backdrops referenced by Colorsets 31-38 for
       FvwmBacker. This is what is displayed on the screen
       background, different for every workspace.
     * backer/bgcache/ subdirectory:
       If FVWM3 is used by NsCDE in non-global monitor
       DesktopConfiguration mode, Large PNG files are generated
       from the existing backdrops in
       $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/backer. This directory contains
       automatically generated hierachy structure of background
       cache for multiple different X RandR monitors when NsCDE is
       used with FVWM3 in non-global DesktopConfiguration mode,
       which are matching various combinations of desks across
       monitors. Referenced in function
       f_SetFvwm3NonGlobalBackground of fvwm/Functions.fvwmconf
       and in $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/xrandr_backer backdrop autocreate
       script.
     * fontsets/ directory:
       If created, user can put or generate with Font Style
       Manager own fontsets here.
     * icons/ directory:
       Populated by dynamic menu action fvwm-menu-desktop. If
       directory does not exist, script will create it.
     * icons/NsCDE/ directory:
       NsCDE custom icons. Put here by Color Style Manager and the
       rest of the tools. Since icons from here are referenced
       with a relative path, whatever is missing here, will be
       loaded from system's $NSCDE_DATADIR/icons/NsCDE
       automatically.
     * libexec/ directory:
       If created, colormgr.local script can be written and put
       here, as well as fontmgr.local and other user's hooks. This
       is done with reasonable defaults for colormgr.local during
       the initial setup of the new NsCDE profile.
     * palettes/ directory:
       User can put custom palette files here, and they can than
       be selected by the Color Style Manager and processed for a
       preview or applied as new theme.
     * templates/ directory:
       Here, local subdirectory of app-defaults with tmpl files
       can be optionally created. Also, it is a good choice for
       Gkrellm or other files processed by the
       libexec/colormgr.local
     * tmp/ directory:
       Place used by parts of the NsCDE and in particular NsCDE's
       FvwmScript programs for temporary generated files for
       previews, or as scratch and work directory. Tools are
       usually taking care to cleanup their garbage from tmp/ on
       exit.
     * XYZ.fvwmconf files:
       Absolute overrides of $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/XYZ.fvwmconf
       files. If in existence, they will be read instead of system
       defaults. XYZ is here placeholder/example for Style,
       Functions, Keybindings, Init, Menus etc ... For some groups
       of FVWM configuration points this makes a sense, for most
       it doesn't see next description for such examples.
     * XYZ.fvwmlocal files:
       Extensions, added values of
       $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/XYZ.fvwmconf files. If in existence,
       they will be read right as the continuation of their
       .fvwmconf main configurations from system (or local)
       directory. This is preferred way to extend functionality or
       override something not big enough for a complete "fork" of
       the config file. Colorset, Backdrops, Animate,
       Font-$DPIdpi, Init, and Subpanel are exception of this,
       that is, it is preferred (if not only thing possible) to
       have it as .fvwmconf files only, and not .fvwmlocal files.
       Style.override file:
       If created, it will be read by the
       $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Style.fvwmconf. Here, core style for
       all windows (*) can be overriden prior to reading
       particular NsCDE application style overrides and addons,
       and prior to reading $FVWM_USERDIR/Style.fvwmlocal. Here,
       advanced users can override or extend core styles which are
       not customizable by the Window Style Manager. See fvwm(1)
       for a huge list of Style options. Putting core Style
       options after NsCDE applications in the
       $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Style.fvwmconf are processed can
       nullify overrides for that particular applications, this is
       why this mechanism is provided. This file is not created in
       $FVWM_USERDIR by setup procedure or Style Managers, but if
       created (manually) it will be read and processed.
       XYZ is here placeholder/example for Style, Functions,
       Keybindings, Init, Menus etc ...
     * NsCDE.conf file:
       managed by Window Style Manager, Workspaces and Pages Style
       Manager, Pointer Style Manager and users own editor
       manually. See the rest of the documentation. NsCDE.conf may
       be considered the most important user configuration NsCDE
       file.
     * WSM.conf file:
       read/written by Workspaces and Pages Style Manager, and
       Graphical Workspace Manager (GWM) Options dialog, and
       user's favorite editor. Not an FVWM config file. System
       default of this file is $NSCDE_DATADIR/defaults/WSM.conf,
       and it is not actively used, because defaults are hardcoded
       in WSM and GWM.
     * FrontPanel.actions file:
       user's overrides/addons for Front Panel icons and actions.
       Written by editor manually, by Copy to Main Panel, Move
       Button Left/Right options of the context submenu of
       subpanel's items. See section about Front Panel for more
       information.
     * GeoDB.ini file:
       part of the Geometry Manager functionality. Written and
       read by the $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/confset and
       $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/confget on Save Geometry" and Reposition
       from Extended and Standard Window Operations menus.
       Windows-like ini files are WAY nicer than dconf and such
       binary registry-like facilities. See detals about Geometry
       Manager for more information.
     * Xdefaults file:
       Read on startup by xrdb(1).
     * Xdefaults.local, Xdefaults.fontdefs, Xdefaults.mouse files:
       Included with preprocessor directives from Xdefaults
     * Xset.conf file:
       Configuration (a batch file or shell script basically) with
       xset(1) parameters for system beep, pointer, keyboard, and
       DPMS settings which are managed by their respective Style
       Managers. User can put here setxkbmap, xgamma and such
       additional X server configuration commands (or whatever one
       likes). Care must be taken not to mess lines beggining with
       #XYZMgr,xxxx till #end, since this is internal marker of
       FvwmScript's buggy WriteToFile function.
     * NsCDE-Sandbox.conf file:
       If exists, used only in bare sandbox mode, where basic
       functionality of the NsCDE is needed, and not full DE-like
       environment.
     __________________________________________________________

11. Installation Dependencies

   For NsCDE to work, essential software is FVWM Window Manager.
   Almost all is based on it. Since NsCDE is heavy user of
   infostore internal variables and other new features of FVWM,
   development has been done on FVWM versions 2.6.7 and 2.6.8. At
   this time, this are recommended, if not mandatory versions of
   FVWM for NsCDE. Other dependencies, that is, software used by
   NsCDE is:

     * Original Korn Shell 93 or newer. All shell script routines
       inside configuration, helper scripts and FvwmScript helpers
       are written with ksh. It is known for sure that pdksh
       cannot be drop in replacement, and in tests on Arch Linux
       with mksh it became clear that mksh cannot replace Korn
       Shell. Korn Shell is available and it is free.
     * Xorg utils (Fedora/CentOS RPM xorg-x11-utils) - xdpyinfo,
       xprop ...
     * Util xdotool - used by FVWM2 which is not patched with
       WindowName patch for the FvwmButtons. Not used by FVWM3.
     * ImageMagick - convert(1), display(1), resize(1) ... really
       needed.
     * Xscreensaver - optional, but Screen Style Manager
       functionality will not work without it. Something needs to
       be installed for locking the screen.
     * cpp - C preprocessor for xrdb functionality - for X
       resources integration. Used by xrdb(1).
     * xorg-x11-server-utils (CentOS, Fedora name) - xrdb, xset,
       xrefresh mandatory for startup, some style managers and
       menus.
     * python-yaml - needed for python part of the color theme
       management and for Gtk+Qt integration.
     * PyQt4 or PyQt5 (or possibly python-qt4, python-qt5 ...)
       This is unfortunate dependency which is further dependent
       on Qt libraries. NsCDE tries to have as less as possible
       dependencies, specially indirect (dependencies of dependent
       dependencies of dependencies ...). Gtk/Qt integration is
       borrowed from CDEtheme Motif/CDE theme project and adapted
       for use with FVWM (instead of heavy Xfce dependency) or
       standalone engine. In part of the Theme.py code, some png
       pixmaps are cut and colored with functions from this API.
       With present job and lack of time, there was no time to do
       this without PyQt4 or PyQt5 for the first public release.
     * Gtk2, Gtk3, Qt4, Qt5, qtconfig-qt4, qt5ct,
       qt5-qtstyleplugins (optional) There is a great chance this
       libraries and some useful programs using them are already
       installed on user's system. If Gtk and Qt integration is
       activated in Color Style Manager, there is no point not to
       have it installed.
       Notice about Qt4 and Qt5: qt4-config (or qt-config) and
       qt5ct: Although colors will be applied, for font setting to
       take effect, qtconfig-qt4 (or qtconfig) must be run,
       something changed back and forth, and then applied/saved -
       no matter that you will see fonts of your choice already
       selected. This can be considered a bug. Same goes for Qt5.
       Notice about Qt5: QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME environment variable
       must be set, and be set to qt5ct value in order to run
       qt5ct configurator. This variable is set by default from
       the $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf.
       If Qt5 Kvantum engine is desired for use with Color Style
       Manager, qt5-style-kvantum must be installed and available,
       otherwise selecting alternative Qt5 integration based on
       Kvantum engine will not work.
     * Recommended fonts for as close as possible CDE look are
       DejaVu Serif for variable, and DejaVu Sans Mono for
       monospaced fonts. Check should be made if this fonts are
       installed on the system. For Solaris CDE look, Lucida Sans
       and monospaced Lucida Sans Typewriter should be installed,
       selected and used instead. (optional)
     * Stalonetray for "tray" facility (optional)
     * Dunst for notification daemon (optional)
     * xterm
     * python3
     * python36-pyxdg or python3-pyxdg
     * libstroke (FVWM2)
     __________________________________________________________

12. Installation

   In it's original non-packaged form, NsCDE release or gut clone
   directory result is in unconfigured source form. NsCDE uses
   autoconf and automake to preprocess it's scripts, programs and
   configurations, and compile 3 helper binaries. Dependencies are
   checked during ./configure phase, but errors are only produced
   if something needed for final product is missing. That is, it
   is assumed that this will be built on some build machines which
   doesn't have installed all runtime dependencies of the NsCDE.

   Much fine grained control over what is needed in build time,
   and what in run time is acomplished when NsCDE is packaged as
   RPM, DEB or Arch package. Fully functional example RPM spec,
   Debian DEB control and Arch PKGBUILD files are provided in pkg
   of the NsCDE source distribution. Thanks to the "-tb" feature
   of RPM, RPM package can be built straight from tarball as
   rpmbuild -tb NsCDE-2.X.tar.gz.

   A generic installation instruction should look familiar:
  $ su - || sudo -i
  # umask 0022
  # cd /tmp
  # wget https://github.com/NsCDE/NsCDE/archive/NsCDE-<version>.tar.gz
  # tar xpzf NsCDE-<version>.tar.gz
  # cd NsCDE-<version>
  # ./configure
  # make
  # make install


   Example above will install NsCDE into /usr/local. However, it
   is possible to install to some other place. For example, this
   will install NsCDE in /opt/sfw, but put XDG menu file in
   /etc/xdg/menus.
  # ./configure --prefix=/opt/sfw --sysconfdir=/etc
  # make
  # make install


   For a latest master tree from development page on Github, NsCDE
   can be fetched with git(1) and upgraded with fetching changes
   in the master or some other branch. An example of this would
   be:
  # git clone https://github.com/NsCDE/NsCDE.git
  # cd NsCDE
  # ./configure
  # make
  # make install


   Upgrades, either from tarball or from git, once new version is
   downloaded can be made by uninstalling and installing NsCDE
   with make(1) tool. Example of upgrade:
  # cd NsCDE
  # make uninstall
  # git fetch
  # git reset --hard @{u}
  # ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
  # make
  # make install


   Running only make uninstall will uninstall NsCDE.

13. NsCDE Startup

   Session can be started from the $HOME/.xsession in last command
   line as exec nscde or ssh-agent nscde or with gpg-agent,
   lxsession or whatever.

   If supported by the X Display Manager which is in use on the
   target system, an xsession file nscde.desktop will be put
   during the installation into /usr/share/xsessions (or in
   whatever place your system and your X Display Manager reads
   this files) and afterwards NsCDE can be selected from the
   display manager's menu or similar session selector. See the
   rest of the X Session Manager integration examples in the
   directory $PREFIX/share/doc/nscde/examples/ for MATE, KDE, LXDE
   and similar DE integrations and play with this if you like.

14. NsCDE Localization

   NsCDE implements localization capabilities provided by FVWM and
   system C library. Directive LocalePath in
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Main.fvwmconf is set to look at
   $[NSCDE_ROOT]/share/locale;NsCDE:$[NSCDE_ROOT]/share/locale;NsC
   DE-Subpanels:+. In other words, whole NsCDE reads it's
   localization from ".mo" files from
   $[NSCDE_ROOT]/share/locale/$LANG/LC_MESSAGES/NsCDE.mo except
   subpanels which have their localization in separate mo files in
   the same directory.

   All FvwmScript based applications are reading their own "mo"
   file from $[NSCDE_ROOT]/share/locale/$LANG/LC_MESSAGES/NsCDE.mo
   which is defined in every program's header with UseGettext
   directive.

   All parts of visible text provided by NsCDE have localization
   ability.

   LANGUAGE and LC_MESSAGES environment variables must be set for
   localization to work correctly. Best way to do this are user's
   login and profile files, but it can also work with parameters
   choosen with display manager's popdown menu or similar
   pre-login mechanism, or as a fallback, $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf
   can be used to assign value of the LC_MESSAGES (or LC_ALL) and
   LANGUAGE commands.

   First translated language from original English is Croatian.
   Other translations are welcome and expected. There are some
   pitfalls and things which must be observed when translating to
   the new languages. Existing .po files in "hr" can serve as a
   template for new translations since just msgstr lines must be
   replaced and msgid's are already there.

   For more information about localization see
   $PREFIX/share/doc/nscde/README.localization README file which
   is also provided with software in the root of the unpacked
   tarball.
     __________________________________________________________

15. Initial Configuration

   Upon the first (successful) start, ~/.NsCDE, that is
   $FVWM_USERDIR is created, and only icons subdirectory is
   created as fvwm-menu-desktop is run. User will be presented
   with a first run NsCDE setup wizard in plain default xterm
   terminal emulator and with default color theme Broica in 8
   colors. If Gkrellm and pnmixer programs are installed, on the
   system and found, they will be run too. Stalonetray and Dunst
   will be run if installed and enabled by the user during the
   wizard process. Stalonetray and Dunst colors and fonts will be
   handled internally by Color Style Manager and Font Style
   Manager when theme or font is changed and the same goes for
   Gkrellm, rofi, Firefox, Thunderbird or any 3rd party program
   integrated with NsCDE color and font theme.

   Initial setup wizard is a simple script
   ($NSCDE_DATADIR/bootstrap) from the terminal which will run
   automatically and will set up the following:

     * X resources in ~/.NsCDE
     * Default background color (pre-FvwmBacker) from default
       theme
     * Default ~/.NsCDE/NsCDE.conf
     * Default ~/.NsCDE/GeoDB.ini
     * ~/.icons/default/index.theme (default X cursor scheme)
     * ~/.gtkrc-2.0
     * ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
     * ~/.themes/NsCDE
     * ~/.config/Trolltech.conf
     * ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf
     * ~/NsCDE/Stalonetray.conf if it does not exist yet
     * ~/NsCDE/Dunst.conf if it does not exist yet
     * Visual Pager NsCDE addon Option
     * Disable or enable XscreenSaver
     * Disable or enable use of the XSETTINGS xsettingsd daemon
     * Disable or enable use of Rofi Launcher on Alt+F12 if
       installed
     * Enable NsCDE to remember last used page on workspace if
       selected
     * Enable FVWM3 diagnostic logging by default or not
     * Configure favorite X file manager, if desired
     * Configure favorite X text editor, if desired

   Figure 71. NsCDE first time setup (bootstrap)

   [fig_bootstrap.png]

   There are more options in $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf which can be
   edited after first setup finishes, and during the desktop
   operation.

   Note that no file from the above list will be overwritten if it
   already exists in it's place. It will be skipped, but GTK and
   Qt theme integration files will be edited with
   $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/confset to change theme and settings. This
   settings can be further edited with Color Style Manager, or
   with the tools from other desktop environments. After bootstrap
   script finishes setup, Color Style Manager will be run and user
   asked to confirm default theme or change it. Do not avoid this
   step, because some program bits are not fully setup if local
   user configuration uses fallback bare defaults, (like a clock
   background) and must be generated in the ~/.NsCDE/icons/NsCDE
   directory.

   After Color Style Manager's OK button is pressed, theme will be
   regenerated. Gtk and Qt themes will be regenerated only if
   their checkboxes in Color Style Manager are checked in. This is
   default since NsCDE 1.0. Setup script after the finish will ask
   user to press RETURN to exit. This is for user's convenience to
   read output of the setup for informative and/or diagnostic
   reasons. It is advised that after this setup
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf is opened and further edited, for
   example InfoStoreAdd internal FVWM variables for terminal,
   browser, docsbrowser, taskmgr, printmgr to user's favorite
   programs for mentioned functions.

   Layout of the $FVWM_USERDIR after the initial setup should look
   like this:

     * app-defaults/
     * backdrops/
     * palettes/
     * fontsets/
     * templates/
     * photos/
     * backer/
     * backer/bgcache
     * GeoDB.ini
     * icons/
     * icons/NsCDE/
     * Backdrops.fvwmgen
     * Colorset.fvwmgen
     * NsCDE.conf
     * NsCDE.rasi
     * tmp/
     * Xdefaults
     * Xdefaults.fontdefs
     * Xdefaults.local
     * Xdefaults.mouse

   It is advised to logout and login from the X session after
   finishing initial setup and check if everything looks ok. Also,
   it is a good idea to start using programs from the menu and
   examine environment around, before customizing Subpanels, and
   Front Panel, running Style Manager (2nd button right of the
   Workspace Manager on the Front Panel) to customize other
   aspects of the interface. NsCDE is now ready for everyday work.
     __________________________________________________________

16. Diagnostic: X11, FVWM and Watch Errors

   Most of the X11 Display Managers, such as XDM, sddm, gdm etc,
   are redirecting diagnostic output (standard error, stderr, file
   descriptor 2) into a file or some logging facility. This file
   is usually $HOME/.xsession-errors. When "Watch Errors" item is
   launched from default subpanel 7 (Desktop Settings), it will
   execute xterm -e $[infostore.xlogcmd]. If not redefined in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf, contents of the FVWM infostore
   variable $[infostore.xlogcmd] will be "tail -300f
   ~/.xsession-errors".

   Figure 72. Watch Errors (logging)

   [fig_watcherrors.png]

   If your X Display Manager is using different path or file name,
   this can be redefined in a way mentioned above. Beware that
   some X Display Managers (namely lightdm) are sending diagnostic
   output into /dev/null. In this case, no variable redefinition
   can get this output visible to the user.

   Reading X, FVWM and NsCDE log output can be informative and
   helpful while solving possible unexpected or unexplainable
   problems with desktop setup.

   Window Options menu (called by titlebar button 1, leftmost) of
   the "Watch Errors" window has a custom menu entry Fvwm
   Diagnostic Console which starts FVWM module FvwmConsole.

   Figure 73. Personalized Window Operations Menu on "Watch
   Errors" window

   [fig_appmenu1.png]
   FvwmConsole on the other hand has custom menu entry Watch
   Errors which calls Watch errors. When both windows are on the
   screen, this menu entries will simply transfer focus to each
   other. Both of this applications have custom Window Options
   Menu "NsCDE Process Manager" which will run the same named
   application on demand.

   Figure 74. FVWM Diagnostic Console

   [fig_fvwmconsole.png]
     __________________________________________________________

17. Integration with X resources and widgets

17.1. Integration of X resources

   NsCDE is using it's own copies of Xdefaults and includes files
   for X resources integration in $FVWM_USERDIR. X resources are
   filled with this from $NSCDE_ROOT/bin/nscde main wrapper during
   startup as the part of session assembling. Variable XAPPLRESDIR
   is also adjusted to $FVWM_USERDIR/app-defaults. There can be
   problems while using certain X session managers or DE which are
   clearing environment on a startup, and in this cases user must
   take care to put environment from nscde wrapper in place after
   startup. Probably autostart job in $HOME/.config/autostart and
   select from Session Manager's app will do the job.

   Special private paths for X resources are used in order not to
   mess with user's maybe existing resources and files. If wanted,
   custom app-defaults files can be placed in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/app-defaults or even better,
   $FVWM_USERDIR/templates/app-defaults and reworked for Color
   Style Manager integration, because if find in that directory,
   and with .tmpl extension, it will be processed in the same way
   as system files from
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/config_templates/app-defaults/ and put in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/app-defaults.

   Plain custom X resources can be put in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Xdefaults.local. This file will not be
   overwritten by Style Managers. X resources integration is
   turned on by default in Color Style Manager.
     __________________________________________________________

17.2. Gtk2, Gtk3, Qt4 and Qt5

   $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/themegen with $NSCDE_LIBDIR/NsCDE/python and
   with $NSCDE_DATADIR/integration/gtk2_gtk3_qt are parts of the
   optional Gtk2, Gtk3, Qt4 and Qt5 integration suite. When run
   from the Color Style Manager or manually with the
   $NSCDE_TOOLSDIR/themegen, with proper options, this will
   produce $HOME/.themes/NsCDE directory with either or both Gtk2
   and Gtk3 themes. $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0 and
   $HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini will be edited to point to
   this directory with gtk-theme-name option. Excessive button
   images on menus and buttons will be turned off of course.

   Figure 75. Example: Audacious with motified NsCDE theme: GTK
   engine for Qt5

   [fig_audacious.png]

   If Qt4 and/or Qt5 integration is also selected in Color Style
   Manager, files $HOME/.config/Trolltech.conf and
   $HOME/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf will be edited to use "GTK2" Qt
   theme engine. This means, there is no Qt4 and/or Qt5
   integration without at least Gtk2 integration because Gtk2
   theme in use is deciding what GTK2 Qt4 and Qt5 engine will
   display. For Qt5 integration, make sure qt5-qtstyleplugins (or
   something like that name) is installed:
   platformthemes/libqgtk2.so is needed.

   As from NsCDE 2.1, Qt5 has an alternative Kvantum based engine
   which can be selected instead of default gtk2 based one. It is
   independent from gtk2 style plugin, but qt5-style-kvantum (or
   similar system dependent package name) must be installed for
   this to work.

   All integrations of this type: GTK2, GTK3, QT4 and QT5 are
   turned on in the Color Style Manager.
     __________________________________________________________

17.3. Mozilla: Firefox and Thunderbird

   Figure 76. Firefox with NsCDE GTK3 theme and NsCDE userChrome
   and userContent CSS

   [fig_firefox.png]

   From version 1.3 and further, NsCDE contains CSS code and icons
   which can be used from $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local
   while applying new color style and theme, to generate colorsets
   also for either or both Firefox and Thunderbird.

   For this to work, appropriate function code definitions from
   the colormgr.local must be sourced from
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/config_templates/colormgr.addons and functions
   do_firefox and/or do_thunderbird must be uncommented in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local. Shell variable
   FIREFOX_PROFILEDIR should contain path to the
   ~/.mozilla/firefox/<profilename>., FIREFOX_MAJVER_PFX should be
   either "7x" or "9x" depending of major version of the Firefox
   is installed and used on the system. Firefox 8x belongs to 9x
   code base. The same as for FIREFOX_PROFILEDIR, variable
   THUNDERBIRD_PROFILEDIR should point to chrome directory of
   user's thunderbird profile. If chrome subdirectory in the
   user's profile directory does not exist, it will be created by
   the above mentioned "do_" functions from colormgr.addons. This
   will make appropriate entiries in userChrome.css and
   userContent.css to import nscdeChrome.css, nscdeIcons.css and
   nscdeContent.css from the $NSCDE_DATADIR/integration/firefox
   and/or from $NSCDE_DATADIR/integration/thunderbird. File
   nscdeColordefs.css will be generated in the chrome dir with
   color mappings to the current NsCDE theme. This wile is also
   imported in userChrome.css and userContent.css.

   If the option "Run $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local (if
   exists)" is not turned off in the Color Style Manager while
   applying a theme, CSS which makes Firefox and Thunderbird as to
   a high degree similar to Motif/CDE application, and in the
   right colors will be generated. Firefox and Thunderbird must be
   restarted for this changes to take a place.

   In Thunderbird, because of the nature of mail, it is not 100%
   possible to use color 4 from the NsCDE theme as
   background/foreground combination, because this can give ugly
   and bad results with some amount of structured HTML mails.
   Hence, color for text is black, while background is from
   Solyaris theme (#fff7e9) which is yellowish, almost white.

   Here is how chrome directory layout and files must look for
   thunderbird after colormgr.local makes a changes:
/home/user/.thunderbird/profile_test_009/chrome
|- nscdeColordefs.css
|- userChrome.css
|- userContent.css


$ cat /home/user/.thunderbird/Profile_1/chrome/userContent.css
@import url("nscdeColordefs.css");
@import url("/usr/share/NsCDE/integration/thunderbird/nscdeContent.css")
;

$ cat /home/user/.thunderbird/Profile_1/chrome/userChrome.css
@import url("nscdeColordefs.css");
@import url("/usr/share/NsCDE/integration/thunderbird/nscdeChrome.css");
@import url("/usr/share/NsCDE/integration/thunderbird/nscdeIcons.css");

   This is how Firefox chromedir should look like, assuming NsCDE
   was installed in /usr as prefix and root of installation dir:
/home/user/.mozilla/firefox/testtest.default-release/chrome
|- nscdeColordefs.css
|- nscdeContent.css -> /usr/share/NsCDE/integration/firefox/ff9x_nscdeCo
ntent.css
|- userChrome.css
|- userContent.css

$ cat /home/user/.mozilla/firefox/testtest.default-release/chrome/userCh
rome.css
@import url("nscdeColordefs.css");
@import url("/usr/share/NsCDE/integration/firefox/ff9x_nscdeChrome.css")
;
@import url("/usr/share/NsCDE/integration/firefox/nscdeIcons.css");

$ cat /home/user/.mozilla/firefox/testtest.default-release/chrome/userCo
ntent.css
@import url("nscdeColordefs.css");
@import url("nscdeContent.css");


   Great care has been taken to get working CSS which modifies
   Mozilla applications not to display light text on light
   background, or dark text on dark background, but this ever
   changing CSS mess should be considered of beta quality, so
   issue reports, specially those with ready made fixes are more
   than welcome.
     __________________________________________________________

17.4. Custom application integration

   If $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local exists, Color Style
   Manager will run it if it's checkbox is selected. This script
   program will be run with a full path of CDE palette file,
   followed by the number of colors selected in the interface (4
   or 8). This can be useful for regenerating settings of
   applications which do not use X resources, and neither GTK nor
   Qt, but have support for some level of customization of this
   resources. Also "skins" for programs like smplayer, audacious
   and Gkrellm can be processed from custom colormgr.local. Many
   of the programs are already defined in the
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/config_templates/colormgr.addons and will be
   enabled by default, or can be enabled in installed example
   $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local.

   In the directory $NSCDE_DATADIR/config_templates/Gkrellm is the
   complete NsCDE theme for the Gkrellm. In the
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/config_templates/colormgr.addons there are
   already ready made functions for Gkrellm, mate-terminal,
   konsole, qterminal, xfce4-terminal, firefox and thunderbird.
   User's additions for further integrating programs into Motif
   and CDE like NsCDE scheme can be added into user's
   $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local, contributions are also
   very welcome.
     __________________________________________________________

18. NsCDE and Cross Desktop Group (Free Desktop) Specifications and
Standards

   NsCDE is the hybrid desktop environment built around FVWM and
   other free software components. Among other things, NsCDE is
   partially using XDG or Free Desktop concepts and subsystems
   such as icon theme format, application menus, application
   ".desktop" launcher files, mime types, preffered applications
   and partially/optionally autostart facility. NsCDE provides
   it's own menu layout and application grouping, as well as icon
   theme which brings CDE icons in their new format and some new
   sizes. Furthermore, NsCDE maintains it's own ".desktop" files
   for launching two types of applications: it's own FVWM or
   FvwmScript based applications and third party, user configured
   preferences for default applications under their generic names.
   NsCDE also provides XDG compatible X Display Manager entries
   for it's own startup during the user login.

   NsCDE partially uses XDG base directory paths defined and found
   by their variable names XDG_DATA_DIRS, XDG_CONFIG_DIRS from the
   $NSCDE_DATADIR/fvwm/Main.fvwmconf, then user dirs as
   XDG_PICTURES_DIR (for dropping screenshots) etc. It defines
   XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP and XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP to NsCDE, and very
   important XDG_MENU_PREFIX to nscde-.

   What is not used are paths such as $HOME/.config for NsCDE
   user's config, and some other XDG facilities such as
   XDG_MUSIC_DIR, XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR and such, simply because they
   are of no use to NsCDE as desktop environment. All this is
   configured and can be reconfigured by the user in
   $HOME/.config/user-dirs.dirs.
     __________________________________________________________

18.1. Desktop Application Entries

   NsCDE provides ".desktop" files which are installed in
   /usr/share/applications, /usr/local/share/applications or some
   other path on the system. This files are visible by their
   friendly name (Name= directive in .desktop file) on Workspace
   Menu, Subpanels Manager and Front Panel Icon Manager. This
   applications, and their grouping with other applications can
   also be found in application manager mode of the file manager,
   if file manager supports this.

   There are two kings of NsCDE ".desktop" files:

     * NsCDE own FVWM or FvwmScript Applications
     * Application Defaults choosen by the user or autodiscovered
       by the NsCDE with their generic names
     __________________________________________________________

18.1.1. NsCDE Own XDG Desktop Application Definitions

   The following list contains NsCDE's own application launchers.
   There should be known that none of this applications can be
   called outside of FVWM, and often not even outside of NsCDE:
   apart from FvwmConsole(1) and Watch Errors terminal wrapped
   applications, all other are written in FvwmScript(1), and they
   often depend on other NsCDE components to work fully and
   properly.

     * nscde-exec.desktop: NsCDE Exec Dialog
     * nscde-fvwmconsole.desktop: FvwmConsole(1)
     * nscde-gwm.desktop: Graphical Workspace Manager (GWM)
     * nscde-nprocmgr.desktop: NsCDE Process Manager
     * nscde-stylemgr.desktop: Style Manager Main Launcher
     * nscde-sysinfo.desktop: Sysinfo Dialog
     * nscde-systemaction.desktop: System Action Dialog
     * nscde-watcherrors.desktop: NsCDE/FVWM and X11 logs and
       standar error output
     * nscde-wspgmgr.desktop: NsCDE Workspaces and Pager Manager
     __________________________________________________________

18.1.2. NsCDE Defaults XDG Desktop Applications

   The following entries will work only under NsCDE, they will
   call nscde_fvwmclnt to execute configured or autodiscovered
   default applications such as WWW browser, terminal, file
   manager, task manager, documentation browser, calclulator etc
   ...

     * NsCDE-AppMgr.desktop: This will display File Manager in
       Application Manager mode of operation if file manager
       supports this.
     * NsCDE-Calculator.desktop: This will search internal catalog
       of apps or display configured calculator application as
       $[infostore.calculator]
     * NsCDE-Editor.desktop: This will search internal catalog of
       apps or display configured editor application as
       $[infostore.xeditor] often choosen are Gvim, Emacs,
       Mousepad etc ...
     * NsCDE-FileMgr.desktop: This will search internal catalog of
       apps or display configured file manager application as
       $[infostore.filemgr]
     * NsCDE-MailReader.desktop: This will search internal catalog
       of apps or display configured mail reader application as
       $[infostore.mailreader]
     * NsCDE-PrintMgr.desktop: This will search internal catalog
       of apps or display configured printer manager application
       as $[infostore.printmgr] often, this will default to CUPS
       web interface, called as http://localhost:631
     * NsCDE-TaskMgr.desktop: This will try to find top, topas,
       prstat, qps, xfce4-taskmanager, lxtask, or any other system
       process list application, or simply open default
       configured. It's internal variable is $[infostore.taskmgr].
     * NsCDE-Terminal.desktop: This will try to find terminal
       emulator applications, or use configured default from
       $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf. It operates under the internal
       variable $[infostore.terminal].
     * NsCDE-Volumectrl.desktop: Try to find some usable audio
       mixer. This is often OS dependent, but will accept also
       standalone applications from other desktop environments.
       Infostore variable is $[infostore.volumectrl].
     * NsCDE-WebBrowser.desktop: One of the most important: find
       usable web browser, or launch configured one:
       $[infostore.browser].
     * NsCDE-DocsBrowser.desktop: Browser for displaying NsCDE
       documentation: by default it is xdg-open or
       $[infostore.browser]. It can be set to khelpcenter or
       chromium in user's $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf.
     __________________________________________________________

18.2. NsCDE Applications Menu

   Applications Menu is often installed in /etc/xdg/menus or
   /usr/local/etc/xdg/menus often on BSD system under the name
   nscde-applications.menu. Applications Menu uses NsCDE
   ".directory" files in /usr/share/desktop-directories to define
   groups of applications. The following groups are configured and
   added in the NsCDE Applications Menu tree:

     * desktop-settings
     * development
     * education
     * games
     * graphics
     * information
     * internet
     * multimedia
     * office
     * other
     * science
     * settings
     * sysconf
     * system
     * utilities
     * utility-accessibility

   This sections or groups are self-descriptive, and thankfuly to
   their translations in other DE products, localized to many
   languages.
     __________________________________________________________

18.3. NsCDE Icon Theme

   NsCDE Icon theme was initially based on MATE desktop
   environment theme, so here and there, some non-CDE icon for
   objects without equivalent in CDE can be found. Apart from CDE
   icons, there are some old Netscape icons, many just created in
   style of CDE and made to visually fit in the picture.
   Speciality of this Icon theme, which is uncommon to Free
   Desktop icon themes is that part or the icons are processed by
   the NsCDE Color Style Manager to put current color palette
   theme into the parts of the icon to fit more nicely into
   applications. GTK based applications often use this, while Qt
   applications somehow escape precedence or $HOME/.icons/NsCDE
   icon hierarchy.

   NsCDE Icon Theme is produced exclusively in PNG image format
   and the following sizes:

     * 16x16: smallest pictograms - used by some programs for
       menus, small toolbars and helper symbols, used also by the
       NsCDE FVWM WindowList and such.
     * 22x22: Also used by programs for toolbars, used by most
       file managers for small icon or detailed list view.
     * 24x24: Similar as 22x22: used by programs for toolbars and
       small decoration, can be configured for file managers
       bigger view while some use them by default, for compact or
       detailed view of files. Used also as fallback for
       notifications. Used by Applications Menu submenu of the
       Workspace Menu:.
     * 32x32: Used in NsCDE Front Panel Subpanels. Can be used by
       file managers for side panel icons, also used by desktop
       notifications. May be used for file manager's simple "icon
       view".
     * 48x48: Biggest full set in NsCDE Icon Theme. Used by window
       icons on workspaces, as well as main Front Panel frame.
       Often used for file manager's simple "icon view".

   Icon contexts or groups are standard, similar or the same as
   with the most other XDG compatible icon themes:

     * actions: For various buttons, toolbars and ... actions
     * apps: default and individual application icons conforming
       to this theme
     * categories: categories of applications - see menu group
       desctiption above
     * devices: removable media, system devices, parts of the
       workstation to control
     * mimetypes: MIME types of files on the filesystem, textual,
       binary, directories, special ...
     * places: Usually thematic directory, computer, network and
       various storage types and databases symbols
     * status: Indicators for warnings, errors, notifications,
       statuses of various controls and similar

   Icon theme is set by the initial NsCDE bootstrap procedure in
   the following places:

     * FVWM: Used internally in ImagePath by default. Note: NsCDE
       uses also old style icon paths to NsCDE/CDE icons
       configured in this same ImagePath
     * Qt5: $HOME/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf
     * GTK2: $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0
     * GTK3: $HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini

   During the initial NsCDE setup (bootstrap), if any of this
   files is found, it will be backed up in the user's home
   directory as a tar(1) file
   "gtk+qt-dot-files-before-nscde-changes-<datestr>.tar.

   Icon theme is not furthermore maintained (enforced) by the
   NsCDE style managers, so that any manual change in above
   mentioned places will result in icon theme change, which can be
   user's choice, but may give incomplete CDE experience while
   using NsCDE. From time to time, there can be individual
   applications which are overriding icon theme, but often can be
   configured in their preferences to use the "system" or
   explicitly configured NsCDE theme. This task cannot be handled
   by NsCDE, so user must take a step to integrate such
   applications to use NsCDE icons. Some applications cannot
   change their hardcoded forced icon theme, while for some, which
   are not followinf Free Desktop icon theme format, separate
   icons can be copied, linked or edited like drop-ins for special
   one-application only theme. Indexed search program (otherwise
   very nice) named "recoll" is one example of the latest
   description: it cannot use any Free Desktop icon theme or part
   of it by default.

   Icon theme usually resides in /usr/share/icons, as NsCDE
   directory, but it can also be found as /usr/local/share/icons
   on BSD systems, or in some other system path such as
   /opt/sfw/share/icons or /usr/pkg/share/icons XDG variable
   XDG_DATA_DIRS content directs various graphical toolkits to
   search icon themes and icons in configured paths. If NsCDE is
   installed in some non-standard place which is not hardcoded in
   toolkits and is not defined in XDG_DATA_DIRS, icon theme will
   fall back to hicolor or system's default, which can result in
   pretty ugly visual experience.

18.4. Application autostart

   Free Desktop standards autostart facility user
   /etc/xdg/autostart or /usr/local/etc/xdg/autostart to find
   system wide autostart entries, and user's own
   $HOME/.config/autostart to find and execute user's explicitly
   defined autostart entries. This ".desktop" files have "Desktop
   Entry" section where everything is defined to start the
   application. Applications autostarted in such way are usually
   applets and tray icons, or even background user-level daemons:
   that is, services, their controls and indicators mainly. Apart
   from XDG autostart facility, for ordinary screen oriented
   programs (but also other things possibly) NsCDE user it's own
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Init.fvwmconf where applications, their
   workspace, page, order and conditions can be programmed by the
   user to satisfy initial state of the environment upon
   successful login. Autostarter for XDG is also conditionally
   started from there.

   If standalone freedesktop autostarter dex (sometimes called
   "dex-autostart") is installed, it will be used by
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Init.fvwmconf function CommonInitFunction in
   local mode: it will read and start ".desktop" files in the
   $HOME/.config/autostart directory.

   In other words, NsCDE does not use, look or start anything from
   /etc/xdg/autostart or /usr/local/etc/xdg/autostart, or some
   other possible system XDG autostart directory. If user wants
   applications to be autostarted, they must be written, put or
   copied into it's own $HOME/.config/autostart. This is due to
   the fact there can be a plenty of unwanted applications, often
   put there by the default desktop environments of Linux
   distributions, default installations of non-user programs and
   such. In other words, user can "pick" from system's autostart,
   or symlink to that items wanted or needed for one's setup and
   usage.
     __________________________________________________________

19. Additional recommended software

   NsCDE is basically a collection of configurations, themes and
   tools around FVWM and is a kind od "hybrid" desktop environment
   as unofficial definition and attempt to define it, user must
   choose some favorite and default applications such as X
   terminal emulator file manager, and X editor, which will then
   be provided to him in occations where programs of that type
   must be called.

   Apart from this, since system tray concept has been introduced
   on X11 and is here to stay, user will need some standalone tray
   application. For this purpose, a logical and really great
   stalonetray (Stand Alone Tray) is more than adequate. When
   NsCDE configuration for stalonetray
   $FVWM_USERDIR/Stalonetray.conf is used, it will have this
   defaults: grid 3x3 and it's place will be in the bottom right
   corner of the screen. Stalonetray is not integrated into Front
   Panel because it's size cannot be known in all times: is it one
   button size, two, ten? It is growing and shrinking depending on
   number of widgets or tray icons, and apart from that, this can
   significantly alter the precious CDE look of the Front Panel. A
   window with traditional mwm/dtwm borders and without title in
   corner of the screen is default in NsCDE. Alternative ideas are
   welcome.

   There are some programs which needs to be run under escalated
   privileges. Usually as root. Some examples are
   firewall-applet(1) for managing firewalld on Linux systems,
   Wireshark etc ... For this purpose on Linux (and most probably
   BSD systems), so called PolicyKit or "polkitd" is used as a
   authenticator component, while on the client side, PolicyKit
   agent must be used. This will then prompt user for a password.
   Since there is no equivalent of this agent as standalone
   DE-indepentent program analogously to stalonetray(1) or
   dunst(1), probably the closest match and most often used is
   polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1 which is usually installed
   in /usr/libexec and relatively without huge dependencies on
   some desktop environment. It can be started from profile, for
   example from InitFunction in $FVWM_USERDIR/Init.fvwmconf or by
   using dex autostarter from this very file (default
   Init.fvwmconf has an example for this).

   Small python program dex(1) can be installed and used from
   InitFunction in $FVWM_USERDIR/Init.fvwmconf. This program can
   be configured to read system autostart files in
   /etc/xdg/autostart and/or user's from $HOME/.config/autostart.
   From here, PolicyKit agent, NetworkManager applet, Nextcloud
   agent, Firewall agent, pnmixer and similar can be started.
   Programs such as stalonetray(1), dunst(1), xsettingsd(1),
   xscreensaver(1) are not candidates for this, since they are
   integrated directly with NsCDE and managed by it's
   configuration and autodetenction procedures.

   If found, and if configured in $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf with
   InfoStore variable nscde_use_dunst set to 1, NsCDE will make
   fresh copy of $FVWM_USERDIR/Dunst.conf if it doesn't already
   exist, and start dunst(1) notification daemon. This standalone
   notification daemon is highly configurable and is Window
   Manager and Desktop Environment agnostic. Usage of dunst(1) is
   highly recommended.

   X Terminal program? Urxvt, xterm, mate-terminal, terminus ...
   user's choice as always. As a slight recommendation,
   mate-terminal from MATE DE can be set to look almost as Dtterm,
   but with richer menu and better UTF-8 handling, the bad thing
   is that configuration if not done via GUI or configuration file
   but is stored in binary DCONF registry, and registry editor
   like dconf-editor or or dconf gsettings must be used for
   non-interactive or CLI editing. Second (if not first) best
   choice is Urxvt, but since it does not have a menu nor a real
   tabs, tmux(1), screen(1) or possibly tabbed(1) can be used for
   the same functionality. Suggestions for more dtterm-like
   alternative are welcome.

   File manager? Since author does not use them very much, there
   is no some strong suggestion. Maybe Krusader from KDE is a best
   choice because it has a lot of features and functions plus two
   pane mode for work. It looks like a total contrast to GNOME way
   of doing things, so it must be good, although it is not at all
   similar to CDE's original dtfile(1), but dtfile(1) is a bad and
   poor file manager anyway. Another reasonable choice can be
   pcmanfm or pcmanfm-qt. For something more original, Xplore file
   manager is written with Motif widget. It looks nice, but it is
   unfinished (lacks real actions for many things, and instead
   input dialogs are popped up for copy/paste ...) it is not
   maintained and developed, and if someone does not brings it up
   from the past it can serve only for overview of directories,
   simple actions and nice Motif decoration. Defined as
   $[infostore.filemgr] in NsCDE.

   Editor? Gvim, Emacs, Xemacs, Nedit ... user's choice. Defined
   as $[infostore.xeditor] in NsCDE.

   Another nice and useful app is Gkrellm for which NsCDE has a
   ready drop-in theme called (of course) NsCDE in
   share/config_templates and it can be put in user's
   ~/.gkrellm2/themes and integrated with Color Style Manager with
   the $NSCDE_DATADIR/config_templates/colormgr.addons which is by
   default called from user's
   $FVWM_USERDIR/libexec/colormgr.local, or the whole code
   definition is in user's colormgr.local if NsCDE has been
   installed prior to version 2.1.

   If standalone freedesktop autostarter dex (sometimes called
   "dex-autostart") is installed, it will be used by default
   Init.fvwmconf function CommonInitFunction in local mode: it
   will read and start ".desktop" files in the
   $HOME/.config/autostart directory.

   X Compositor: if user likes visual effects with tinting,
   transparency, shadows, 3D, smooth changes and so on,
   compton(1), compton-ng(1) or picom(1) standalone compositors
   are excellent programs and tools for such users, who want to
   combine retro and modern style. In the time of writing this, it
   looks like picom(1) is the most maintained of this three X
   compositors. Personally, I feel it like some kind of lag, no
   matter how powerful GPU, CPU and RAM I have. I turn it on
   occasionally, more as an amusement of xsnow, xsanta or xeyes
   type, but when I have serious work to do, I simply turn it off
   in some moment. Maybe it can be better if it is configured more
   conservative than example. See
   /opt/NsCDE/share/examples/compton-integration for a starting
   point. Syntax of this file is largely compatible for all three
   above mentioned X compositors.

   Notice: when X Compositor is active on X display, FVWM geometry
   indicator which is shown at the center of the screen during
   window move or resize actions will not be visible. Also,
   consider uncommenting NSCDE_REDRAW_WORKAROUND and set it to 1
   in your $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDe.conf.
     __________________________________________________________

20. Single Logical Screen, Xinerama - multiscreen support

   NsCDE has a basic support for the multiscreen setup which is
   basic as it is FVWM2 multiscreen support, with couple of menus
   added and functions dealing with move and resize operations
   which are aware of the multiple logical screens. Single logical
   screen is referred as "SLS" in FVWM and NsCDE documentation.
   Screens are implemented (and this cannot be changed in FVWM2)
   on the sub-page level. In other words, as workspaces (desks)
   contains pages, pages are split to two or more monitors inside
   one single page. This can be a bit confusing in the combination
   with edge scrolling and window positioning and it takes some
   practice to become comfortable with such third, non-trivial
   space on the screen which is already divided logically in two
   levels. Better solution here will be to use FVWM3 which is
   slowly becoming of non-beta quality at the time of writing
   this. FVWM3 has native XRandR support.

   Monitor handling by the Xrandr X extension is out of scope for
   NsCDE under FVWM2 and is dealed with xrandr(1) command and
   other such tools. Nevertheless, when other monitor is added to
   the system in SLS mode, FVWM/NsCDE must be restarted (restart
   session simply) to recompute spaces, screen sizes and so on.
   After restart, two new menus are available: One on Root menu on
   which there are entries to move all windows on current screen,
   or to pick a window for moving to some of the (xrandr
   identified names) logical screens connected to the system.
   Second menu will appears on the "Window Options" menu called
   from the first titlebar button of the window or from the root
   version of the "Window Options" menu. This menu allows moving
   current window to other logical screen.

   When logical monitor is disconnected from the X setup, FVWM
   NsCDE must be restarted again to get things right.

   Front Panel will appear on the primary screen, but can be moved
   to other screens by Ctrl+Backspace pressed while pointer is on
   the desired screen. This does not work always well when logical
   screens are of different resolution and it is specially visible
   when making third mouse click on the Workspace Manager buttons
   which can be popped down below the screen instead of up to be
   visible. On the monitors of the same resolution in SLS
   configuration, no such problem exists.

   All other functions and window positioning managed directly by
   the NsCDE will handle windows and transient windows correctly,
   so no windows centered between two screens are expected, but
   some barely visible flickering and quick moving can be observed
   by some parts of the NsCDE in some cases. For example, PGM -
   page manager left down from the Workspace Manager on the Front
   Panel when clicked will popup "Go to Page ..." menu in a more
   free floating form, and not directly above PGM dynamic icon and
   such things ...

   NsCDE under FVWM3 is a different story. FVWM3 implements couple
   different multimonitor modes of operation which are configured
   with DesktopConfiguration command in FVWM3 config. NsCDE under
   FVWM3 can manage and change this modes of operation from the
   Workspaces and Pages Style Manager. Currently, supported
   workspace modes of operation are: global, per-monitor and
   shared. See fvwm3(1) for explanation and detailed documentation
   how this multi-monitor models are behaving and how they are
   implemented. In non-global mode, Local Pager, Global Pager and
   GWM will be showing only workspaces and pages from the current
   monitor on which they are started (and possibly updated in the
   future versions of FVWM3).
     __________________________________________________________

21. Similarities and differences in usage and look between CDE and
NsCDE

   NsCDE is not a mere clone of CDE. Under the first visual
   impression, there are some unintentional and intentional
   differences.

   First of all, it is not a standalone Window Manager or Desktop
   Environment written in some language(s), tightly integrated as
   uniform army of tools (like lxqt, xfce4 ...). It is a patchwork
   which owns 80% of it's functionality to wonderful and powerful
   Window Manager of FVWM. Other parts are standalone desktop
   tools and implementations of desktop concepts which are
   integrated, various configurations, scripts and programs which
   are making the whole thing to function like one entirety: the
   combination of the CDE experience and modern powerful X Window
   Manager ... a hybrid desktop environment. Here are some things
   that I can recall to be different - for the worse or for the
   better, user's opinion may vary.

   What is similar or the same:

     * There is a recognizable titlebar and buttons
     * Titlebar buttons have the same basic (left click) actions
       as CDE
     * Color themes and theming
     * Front Panel and subpanels
     * Workspace Manager
     * Workspace Menu / Root Menu (right click on the root window)
     * Workspaces (desks)
     * Many of the icons are reused for XDG compatible icon theme
     * Backdrops
     * Style Manager launcher and most of the Style Managers
     * Occupy Workspace/Page/Monitor dialog
     * Workstation Info window
     * FpLite (not with the same function)
     * Front Panel clock, calendar and check mail
     * Icon positioning
     * Look and feel via FVWM Styles
     * Nice vintage wait cursor in the sand clock shape
     * Various misc small imitations ...

   Differencies exist: for worse or better. They are described
   here in detail with complete explanations:

     * Workspace Manager has a four default choices for workspaces
       (desks). As in CDE four is a default, but combinations with
       2, 6 and 8 are possible. Workspace Manger can be of dynamic
       width when number of workspaces is changed, or it can be of
       fixed width if InfoStore variable wsm.eco is set to 1 in
       $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf.
     * No drag and drop. This is specially visible in Install Icon
       action which actually calls custom tool Subpanel Manager
       for this actions. Subpanel Manager itself will be rewritten
       in a nicer and less buggy way on the first good occasion.
     * No Dt Actions builder, and never will be. Write FvwmScript
       scripts or use some toolkit in combination with python,
       perl ...
     * There is no really a functional Application Manager. If
       integration with Install Icon and possibly menus will be
       possible with some file manager, it may be (re)invented in
       the future. The good candidates are pcmanfm and pcmanfm-qt,
       but this has it's own problems which are yet to be solved.
     * Keybindings are 90% custom made, and user have a choice to
       use it or - partially or totally rewrite it. There are more
       functions and actions in NsCDE than in CDE, and hence there
       are a lot of key bindings.
     * Mouse bindings - some actions like Workspace Menu in CDE
       are mimicked in NsCDE, titlebar and titlebar buttons too,
       but since there is no much of them in original CDE anyway,
       there is a plenty of custom mouse bindings and mouse
       bindings in combination with modifier keys. As for
       keybindings apply: use it or write your own.
     * Color Style Manager has numerous new functions: Gtk and Qt
       integration, X resources integration is optional, and it
       has even a possibility to run a custom script with required
       parameters of current palette and number of colors for
       external and marginal color scheme integrations - like
       Gkrellm for example.
     * Font Style Manager is totally NsCDE oriented and doesn't
       work the same as font management in CDE. NsCDE supports XFT
       fonts (disable antialiasing if you want extreme original
       look) and it combines 5 groups of fonts in 3 sizes
       described in this documentation.
     * Keyboard Style Manager implements all options supported by
       the xset(1) on PC. CDE original in default installation at
       least, seems to have only auto-repeat and click volume
       controls.
     * Mouse Style Manager does not have configurable middle mouse
       (button 2) action since this is not applicable very much on
       today's GUI widgets.
     * Beep Style Manager has a additional Beep button for testing
       during setup.
     * Screen Style Manager is in fact Xscreensaver setup. Perfect
       drop in replacement and much fancier than original.
     * Window Style Manager manages much more of window, icon,
       pages and animation behavior than original program in CDE,
       and even this is a small subset of options in FVWM. See
       it's documentation and fvwm(1) man page.
     * Power Style Manager is actually very rare in Style Manager
       across old CDE setups. It manages DPMS setting of the
       monitor with xset(1).
     * Workspaces and Pager Style Manager is NsCDE custom tool for
       managing Workspaces and Pages. It is not present in any
       version of the CDE.
     * Startup Style Manager is available only if NsCDE is started
       under some X Session Manager. It detects supported DE's and
       starts appropriate settings tool for that desktop
       environment if it is found.
     * Pages: not present in CDE in best of my knowledge. Only
       workspaces (desks) in original. Page Manager (PGM) is a
       custom FrontPanel icon which is using place left bottom of
       the Workspace Manager. It popups menu with the list of
       pages and can change current page.
     * Custom keyboard and mouse actions on titlebars, buttons and
       root window.
     * GeometryMgr - Manages custom X11 window starting size and
       position. NsCDE invention.
     * FpLite is measuring system load, not desktop activity. It
       has much more fine grained indication of activity with
       colors, and it's height is 3x of the original for a better
       visibility. On click it is calling FVWM function which will
       run terminal program with top or similar program
       ($[infostore.taskmgr]), or anything else if user overrides
       that function in local configuration (NsCDE.conf) with
       InfoStore variable.
     * Calendar and Mail widgets are placeholders and simple
       indicators which are expected to be extended with already
       named functions to do what user wants. Mail widget will
       call either default user's mailer program, or it will try
       to guess from the names of some popular programs if they
       are installed on the system.
     * Probably there are more small differences.
     __________________________________________________________

22. Patches for FVWM

   Optional but recommended patches for FVWM from 2.6.7 to 2.6.9
   are in patches/fvwm2 top directory of the NsCDE tarball for
   installation.

   This patches will add:

     * corrections for cursor icon under buttons of the
       FvwmScript(1) it is really not a nice thing to have
       XC_hand2 which is usually used for hyperlinks as a pointer
       icon when mouse is above buttons. Implemented as an option
       in FVWM3, not to disturb old default, no matter how bad is
       that default probably is.
     * FvwmButtons(1) WindowName support - an native alternative
       to xdotool(1) workaround. It will set name and icon name of
       single subpanels, that is, every FvwmButtons object which
       has titlebar enabled with FVWM styles. Implemented by
       default in FVWM3.
     * FvwmButtons triangle-in (sunken) support. Provides a 3rd
       argument for indicator parameter of the FvwmButtons(1)
       button. It can be "in" (default for NsCDE in
       fvwm/FrontPanel.fvwmconf) or "out" to confirm the FVWM
       default. If omitted, "out" is default, since it was that
       way before this patch. Implemented by default in FVWM3.

   In order to have patched FVWM2, apply this patch or patches
   against FVWM 2.6.7, 2.6.8 or 2.6.9 source and (re)compile
   FVWM2. You can even make your own RPM DEB, Arch, BSD, SunOS or
   similar package from that and install it.
     __________________________________________________________

23. FVWM3 Support

   NsCDE from version 1.3 has late beta quality of support for
   FVWM3. NsCDE is and will stay compatible for FVWM2 as long as
   possible. At the time of this writing, FVWM3 was in it's fourth
   release and much of the previous problems are solved, altrough
   it still has some problems with FvwmPager in multi-monitor
   setup. Nevertheless, NsCDE will search for "fvwm3" and then
   "fvwm2" and "fvwm" in $PATH. If both, FVWM3 and FVWM2 are
   installed on the same system, from NsCDE 2.0 and up, FVWM3 has
   higher priority. This can be overriden in user's environment
   (for example $HOME/.bashrc) by setting environment variable
   FVWM_BIN with the value which points to name of the FVWM
   binary, or full path to the binary if for example, FVWM3 was
   installed from source in some non-standard place out of the
   path.

   For example:
export FVWM_BIN=/opt/fvwm3/bin/fvwm3

   or ...
export FVWM_BIN=fvwm3

   or ...
export FVWM_BIN=fvwm

   When running with FVWM3, NsCDE will behave almost identical as
   in FVWM2, with benefit of RandR support in multiple monitors
   setup. This allows dynamic addition and removal of physical
   monitors and better management of such configurations.

   Probably the most notable feature of FVWM3 is
   DesktopConfiguration. FVWM3 configuration parameter
   DesktopConfiguration decides of workspaces layout in case of
   multiple monitors. For now, there are three options: "global"
   (default), "per-monitor" and "shared". First option is very
   similar in layout to old Xinerama support in FVWM2, while
   second and third model are splitting workspaces, so different
   parts of different workspaces can be shown on different
   monitors. NsCDE implements dynamic finding and displaying, as
   well as creation of joint backdrops combinations for multiple
   monitors layout out of the box, so old hack described in
   $NSCDE_ROOT/share/doc/nscde/examples/fvwm3-per-monitor/README
   is not needed anymore. As in the future more desktop layouts
   are planned by FVWM3 developers, this setting has it's GUI
   control usable on FVWM3 in the Workspaces and Pages Style
   Manager. NsCDE provides InfoStoreAdd desktopconfiguration
   directive in the $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf when FVWM3 is used.
   This value can be edited manually to contain "global",
   "per-monitor" or "shared" value, or Workspaces and Pages
   Manager can be used for that task.

   Third difference between NsCDE under FVWM2 and FVWM3 is
   logging. While FVWM2 is logging all it's actions on X server's
   standard output and standard error, which usually ended up in
   $HOME/.xsession-errors, FVWM3 logs into default or configured
   log file. In NsCDE this file is $FVWM_USERDIR/tmp/fvwm.log. By
   default, FVWM3 does not log anything there if not invoked with
   "-v" option, but logging can be toggled by sending SIGUSR2 to
   FVWM3 process. When Watch Errors menu item is called, it has
   one new option on personalized window menu which is called from
   the first (left) titlebar button: Togle FVWM3 Logging. When
   opening this log window, FVWM3 logging will be enabled almost
   immediately. To have logging enabled as soon as possible when
   FVWM3 is started or restarted, infostore variable
   $[infostore.fvwm3_default_logging] should be set in
   $FVWM_USERDIR/NsCDE.conf.

   Caution: using NsCDE under FVWM3 is still a bit of beta
   quality. Example of the current unsolved FVWM3 bug: Local Pager
   shown when changing pages and workspaces will contain primary
   monitor content, which will be wrong on the secondary
   monitor(s). Any misbehaviour should be carefully distinguished
   if it is NsCDE or FVWM3 bug while deciding where to report
   bugs. Watching logs, trying to trigger the same error under
   FVWM2 will be a good starting point for diagnostic of such
   problems which may manifest itself.

24. Credits

   Apart from FVWM, GTK integration framework was forked from one
   advanced theme, clock is old standalone widget which I have
   found in the old X11 software archives while searching for
   something which can act as a Front Panel clock. Pclock fits
   here perfectly. Xscreensaver seems to me as a logical choice
   for screensaver facility.

     * For forked CDEtheme: Jos van Riswick
     * For pclock on a Front Panel: Alexander Kourakos
     * For using Xscreensaver: Jamie Zawinski

25. Missing parts and existing problems

     * Application Manager: Maybe with the help of some extensible
       (but sane and standalone, with normal titlebar) file
       manager, but question remains how to send enumerated apps
       from such a file manager view to Front Panel subpanels or
       as submenu. Probably external drag and drop applet which
       can be swallowed in subpanels to accept drop with middle
       mouse move and edit subpanel configuration? This will than
       replace Subpanels Manager app, but it must also have
       functions for editing, deleting etc ... In the time of
       writing this, file managers supporting this functionality
       with menu://applications/ pseudo path are known to be
       PCManFM and PCManFM-qt. Any KDE KIO based application with
       the right set of plugins installed on the system can serve
       as a application manager. For example, file managers
       Dolphin, Krusader and Konqueror are known to use programs:
       pseudo path. If some of above mentioned applications are
       found on the system it will be defined as
       $[infostore.appmgr] and placed on the Front Panel's eighth
       launcher instead of icon for default editor.

     * Action builder (dtaction) - not likely ever. Use FvwmScript
       or maybe some Python gui bindings.
     * Session Management (dtsession) - NsCDE can use the external
       custom Session Managers from various DE's. See examples in
       $NSCDE_ROOT/share/doc/nscde/examples. Since there are
       similar programs in existence, plus FVWM's own functions
       for automatic start of programs, NsCDE is more or less
       covered here.
